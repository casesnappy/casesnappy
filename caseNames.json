			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The Prime Minister advised the Queen to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, from September 9 to October 14, 2019.<br>• Gina Miller, the appellant, argued that the advice given to the Queen was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions.<br>• The Scottish Court of Session found that the advice was unlawful, while the English Divisional Court found it was non-justiciable.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue in the case was whether the Prime Minister's advice to prorogue Parliament was justiciable and, if so, whether it was unlawful.<br>• The appellant argued that the advice was unlawful because it frustrated or prevented the constitutional role of Parliament.<br>• The respondent, the Prime Minister, argued that the matter was non-justiciable as it was a political question and not one for the courts.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The UK Supreme Court unanimously held that the Prime Minister's advice was justiciable and that it was unlawful.<br>• The Court found that the advice had an extreme effect upon the fundamentals of democracy and therefore could be subject to judicial review.<br>• The Court declared the advice unlawful, void and of no effect, meaning that Parliament had not been prorogued.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'Let us remind ourselves of the foundations of our constitution.

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• Privacy International, a human rights organization, brought a claim against the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) and other defendants, challenging the lawfulness of the regime for the interception and use of communications data under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA).<br>• The IPT is a judicial body responsible for hearing complaints against the intelligence services.<br>• Privacy International argued that the IPT's decisions were not subject to adequate judicial scrutiny and that RIPA was incompatible with EU law.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue was whether RIPA provided an adequate legal framework for the interception and use of communications data, and whether the IPT's decisions were subject to adequate judicial scrutiny.<br>• Privacy International argued that the regime was incompatible with EU law and violated the right to privacy, while the defendants argued that the regime was necessary for national security and subject to sufficient safeguards.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court held that RIPA was incompatible with EU law because it did not provide for an independent body to authorize the interception of communications data, and because it did not require prior review by a court or independent administrative body.<br>• The Court also held that the IPT did not provide adequate judicial scrutiny of the intelligence services' activities, as it did not have the power to quash decisions or provide effective remedies for violations of human rights.<br>• However, the Court declined to make a formal declaration of incompatibility, as the relevant provisions had already been replaced by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'A determination vitiated by any error of law, jurisdictional or not, was to be treated as no determination at all. It therefore fell outside the reference in the ouster clause to a “determination of the commission”. In other words, the reference to such a determination was to be read as a reference only to a legally valid determination.'

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The case of R (on the application of UNISON) (Appellant) v Lord Chancellor (Respondent) [2017] UKSC 51 involved a challenge to the lawfulness of employment tribunal fees introduced in 2013.<br>• The fees, which ranged from £390 to £1200, were required to be paid by claimants in order to bring a claim before an employment tribunal.<br>• UNISON argued that the fees hindered access to justice and were discriminatory against women and other protected groups.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue in the case was whether the employment tribunal fees were unlawful and discriminatory.<br>• UNISON argued that the fees were a violation of the principle of access to justice, as they prevented workers from enforcing their employment rights.<br>• The Lord Chancellor argued that the fees were necessary to reduce the burden on taxpayers and to deter frivolous claims.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously held that the employment tribunal fees were unlawful and discriminatory.<br>• The court found that the fees had prevented access to justice and discriminated against women, as they were more likely to bring low-value claims that were disproportionately affected by the fees.<br>• The court also found that the fees were not reasonably necessary to achieve the stated policy goals of reducing the burden on taxpayers and deterring frivolous claims.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'The constitutional right of access to the courts is inherent in the rule of law. The importance of the rule of law is not always understood. Indications of a lack of understanding include the assumption that the administration of justice is merely a public service like any other, that courts and tribunals are providers of services to the “users” who appear before them, and that the provision of those services is of value only to the users themselves and to those who are remunerated for their participation in the proceedings. The extent to which that viewpoint has gained currency in recent times is apparent from the consultation papers and reports discussed earlier' (para. 66, Lord Reed)"

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• This case concerned the legality of the UK government triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which would begin the process of leaving the EU.<br>• The claimants argued that the government could not trigger Article 50 without an Act of Parliament.<br>• The government argued that it had the power to trigger Article 50 under the royal prerogative.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue was whether the government had the power to trigger Article 50 without an Act of Parliament.<br>• The claimants argued that triggering Article 50 would result in a change in domestic law and therefore required parliamentary approval.<br>• The government argued that the royal prerogative allowed it to make and unmake treaties without the need for parliamentary approval.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the claimants, stating that an Act of Parliament was required before the government could trigger Article 50.<br>• The court held that triggering Article 50 would result in a change in domestic law, and that the royal prerogative could not be used to change domestic law.<br>• The court also held that the European Communities Act 1972, which gave effect to EU law in the UK, could not be repealed without an Act of Parliament.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• '...the EU Treaties not only concern the international relations of the United Kingdom, they are a source of domestic law, and they are a source of domestic legal rights many of which are inextricably linked with domestic law from other sources.

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• In R v Jogee (Appellant) [2016] UKSC 8, two men, Jogee and Ruddock, were convicted of murder after they burgled a house and Ruddock fatally stabbed the homeowner.<br>• The trial judge instructed the jury that if they found that Jogee was a party to the crime, he would be guilty of murder as well.<br>• This was based on the doctrine of joint enterprise, which holds that if two or more people are jointly involved in a crime, they are all equally responsible for any foreseeable consequences, including murder.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The central issue in the case was whether the doctrine of joint enterprise had been applied too widely.<br>• Jogee argued that the law had been misinterpreted and that he should not have been convicted of murder simply on the basis of his involvement in the burglary.<br>• The prosecution argued that the doctrine was an important tool for holding criminals accountable and should not be abolished or restricted.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The UK Supreme Court ruled that the doctrine of joint enterprise had been wrongly interpreted by the courts for over 30 years.<br>• They held that the doctrine had been applied too widely and that it was not enough to simply prove that someone was involved in a crime in order to convict them of murder.<br>• Instead, the prosecution needed to prove that the defendant had intended to commit murder or had foreseen that murder was a possible consequence of their actions.<br>• The court also held that the doctrine should not be abolished entirely, as it played an important role in certain cases.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'as a matter of law, it is enough that D2 intended to assist D1 to act with the requisite intent. That may well be the situation if the assistance or encouragement is rendered some time before the crime is committed and at a time when it is not clear what D1 may or may not decide to do. Another example might be where D2 supplies a weapon to D1, who has no lawful purpose in having it, intending to help D1 by giving him the means to commit a crime (or one of a range of crimes), but having no further interest in what he does, or indeed whether he uses it at all.' (Lord Hughes and Toulson, para. 90)<br>• 'In cases of secondary liability arising out of a prior joint criminal venture, it will also often be necessary to draw the jury’s attention to the fact that the intention to assist, and indeed the intention that the crime should be committed, may be conditional. The bank robbers who attack the bank when one or more of them is armed no doubt hope that it will not be necessary to use the guns, but it may be a perfectly proper inference that all were intending that if they met resistance the weapons should be used with the intent to do grievous bodily harm at least.'

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• Nadine Montgomery sued Lanarkshire Health Board for alleged negligence during her pregnancy and childbirth which led to her son's serious disabilities. Montgomery, a diabetic patient, was not informed by her supervising doctor, of a 9-10% risk of shoulder dystocia due to her condition, a situation where the baby's shoulders are too wide to pass through the mother’s pelvis. <br>• The doctor argued it wasn't her policy to inform patients of such risks as they are minor and could lead patients opting for caesarean section unnecessarily. <br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The appeal asked whether the omission by the doctor to inform the patient about the risks during the delivery amounted to a breach of her duty of care. <br>• The test employed to decide this was the Bolam test (whether an omission is accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical opinion and not irrational). <br>• The lower courts dismissed the claim, stating the omission did not meet the Bolam test's parameters and that Montgomery would have likely gone ahead with a vaginal birth even if made aware of the risk. <br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Montgomery. It critiqued the Bolam test's application, arguing that it allowed doctors too much discretion to not inform patients of risks. <br>• To make a decision about their treatment, the court said, patients must be informed about all material risks and reasonable treatment alternatives. <br>• A 'material' risk is one to which a reasonable person would attach significance, or the doctor is, or should be reasonably aware that the patient would attach importance to it. <br>• Based on Dr McLellan's admission that she had anticipated Montgomery opting for a caesarean section upon risk disclosure, the court concluded that Montgomery would have opted for a caesarean had she been informed of the risk.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'An adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent must be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity is undertaken. The doctor is therefore under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments. The test of materiality is whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patient’s position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to it.'

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The case stemmed from a journalist's request for disclosure of letters between government departments and HRH the Prince of Wales.<br>• The request was denied and upheld by several bodies, eventually leading to the Attorney General issuing a certificate that prevented disclosure.<br>• This certificate could override the decision of the Upper Tribunal, equal to the High Court, to disclose the letters.<br>• The Divisional Court dismissed Mr Evans's case, but the Court of Appeal allowed his appeal.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Mr Evans challenged the validity of the Attorney General's Certificate, mainly on the grounds that the Attorney General didn't possess 'reasonable grounds'.<br>• The Departments disputed this, arguing they were entitled to refuse disclosure.<br>• Questions also arose as to whether certain regulations complied with EU law, specifically Council Directive 2003/4/EC.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court dismissed the Attorney General's appeal, ruling the certificate invalid.<br>• A majority (5:2) concluded the Attorney General was not entitled to issue such a certificate.<br>• By 6:1 majority, the court held that the regulation in contention was incompatible with the 2003 Directive and hence, even if it did relate to environmental information, the certificate would have been invalid.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'it is a basic principle that a decision of a court is binding as between the parties, and cannot be ignored or set aside by anyone, including (indeed it may fairly be said, least of all) the executive.'

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong> <br>• This case focused on the topic of assisted suicide and the law in England and Wales.  <br>• Mr Nicklinson and Mr Lamb, suffering from debilitating conditions, sought clarification whether a doctor terminating their life or assisting their suicide would be lawful. <br>• Mr Martin, physically incapacitated due to a stroke, wanted to travel to Switzerland to make use of the Dignitas service, a lawful provider of assisted suicide.  <br>• All appellants questioned whether the law relating to assisting suicide infringed the European Convention on Human Rights (Convention). <br><br><strong>Issues</strong> <br>• The key issue was whether UK’s assisted suicide laws infringed upon the Convention. <br>• The appellants contended that they had the right to decide when and how they should die, arguing that the law interfered with their decision-making, infringing their rights under Article 8 of the Convention. <br>• The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), however, maintained that such prohibition was necessary to protect vulnerable individuals who might succumb to pressure to end their lives. <br><br><strong>Decision</strong> <br>• The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal by a majority of seven to two. It was determined that the current law on assisted suicide, although engaging Article 8, was not incompatible with Article 8 as it was necessary for the protection of vulnerable individuals. <br>• The Court urged Parliament to consider whether changes should be made to the laws on assisted suicide, issuing a challenge for legislators to think about the controversial matter. <br>• In regards to the second appeal, the Court unanimously allowed the DPP's appeal stating that it was not within its jurisdiction to dictate what should be in the DPP's policy on this matter.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• '...the Parliamentary process is a better way of resolving issues involving controversial and complex questions of fact arising out of moral and social dilemmas.

The decision was included in a command paper, “High Speed Rail: Investing in Britain’s Future – Decisions and Next Steps”.<br>• The appellants, who challenged the government's decision, initially won the case on some arguments but lost on grounds that form the basis of their appeal. The Supreme Court heard the case on appeal.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong>:<br>• The court had to decide whether or not a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) under Directive 2001/42/EC ('the SEA Directive') should have preceded the DNS.<br>• Appellants argued that the decision-making process was predetermined by planning measures that bypassed the environmental impact assessment (EIA) stage.<br>• Furthermore, the Court had to decide if the hybrid bill procedure for gaining the development consent for HS2 complied with the procedural requirements of Directive 2011/92/EU ('the EIA Directive').<br>• It was claimed that the hybrid bill procedure prevented effective public participation.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong>:<br>• The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. It held that the DNS didn't constrain Parliament, the authority responsible, and thus it wasn't a 'plan' or 'programme' under SEA Directive since it didn't set the framework for granting consents.<br>• It also concluded that the hybrid bill procedure complied with the EIA Directive. There was no reason to suspect that Members of Parliament would be unable to adequately examine and debate the proposed project.<br>• The court saw no need to make a preliminary reference to the CJEU in this case.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s):</strong><br>• 'The United Kingdom has no written constitution, but we have a number of constitutional instruments.

The European Communities Act 1972, the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 may now be added to this list. The common law itself also recognises certain principles as fundamental to the rule of law. It is, putting the point at its lowest, certainly arguable (and it is for United Kingdom law and courts to determine) that there may be fundamental principles, whether contained in other constitutional instruments or recognised at common law, of which Parliament when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation' - Lords Neuberger and Mance at paragraph 207"

The finding of an agreement or arrangement to share in this sense can only, I think, be based on evidence of express discussions between the partners, however imperfectly remembered and however imprecise their terms may have been. Once a finding to this effect is made it will only be necessary for the partner asserting a claim to a beneficial interest against the partner entitled to the legal estate to show that he or she has acted to his or her detriment or significantly altered his or her position in reliance on the agreement in order to give rise to a constructive trust or a proprietary estoppel.': Lord Bridge<br>• 'It was common ground that Mrs. Rosset was extremely anxious that the new matrimonial home should be ready for occupation before Christmas if possible.

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• R v Cunningham [1957] 2 QB 396 is a leading criminal case in English law, which established the mens rea (mental element) requirement for reckless harm.<br>• The defendant, Cunningham, had stolen money from a gas meter in a neighbouring property, which resulted in gas seeping through the walls into the occupied property next door, endangering the life of the occupant.<br>• Cunningham was charged with administering a noxious substance so as to endanger life, contrary to section 23 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The key issue in this case was whether Cunningham’s actions met the mens rea requirement necessary for his conviction under section 23, and thus whether he should be found guilty.<br>• The prosecution argued that the defendant had at least been criminally negligent in his actions, and that his recklessness should be seen as sufficient to establish mens rea.<br>• The defence argued that Cunningham had not foreseen the risk of harm to others, and as such, did not have the necessary mens rea for this specific crime.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court of Appeal allowed Cunningham's appeal and quashed his conviction. The trial judge had incorrectly defined 'malicious' as 'wicked'.<br>• The court held that the mens rea requirement for reckless harm is the subjective test of whether the defendant foresaw the risk, as opposed to the objective test of whether a reasonable person would have foreseen the risk (previously used in cases such as R v Faulkner).<br>• The court found that Cunningham had not foreseen the risk of harm, and therefore did not possess the necessary mens rea for this specific crime."

We are searching for a principle upon which, in limited circumstances, recognition may be given to a need, in the interests of the patient, that treatment should be given to him in circumstances where he is (temporarily or permanently) disabled from consenting to it. It is this criterion of a need which points to the principle of necessity as providing justification.' (Lord Goff of Chieveley)"

Bellinger [2003] UKHL 21, the appellant, Elizabeth Bellinger, had undergone male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, and had sought a declaration that her marriage to her husband Michael was valid.<br>• Importantly, her birth certificate still identified her as male, and her chromosomal sex remained XY (male).<br>• In arguing the validity of the marriage, Elizabeth relied on the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), particularly Article 8 (respect for private and family life) and Article 12 (right to marry). <br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue before the House of Lords was whether a post-operative transsexual person should be regarded as a woman under English marriage law, or whether the biological definition at birth should prevail.<br>• Elizabeth's argument was based on the concept of evolving social conscience, suggesting that the UK legislation failed to keep up with the times, and that strict adherence to the biological definition violated her rights under the ECHR.<br>• In response, the House of Lords considered whether the interpretation of the English marriage law should be adapted in light of the decision in Goodwin v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 18, a case where the European Court of Human Rights held that the UK had failed to adequately respect the right to private life of a transsexual person.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The House of Lords held that the English marriage law could not be adapted to recognise Elizabeth as a woman, and therefore her marriage was deemed to be void.<br>• The Lords noted that the interpretation of the term 'woman' in the context of marriage law was based on biological factors, rather than the psycho-social factors.<br>• They further held that although the ECHR could be relied upon to alter the UK law, it was not within the competence of the courts to make such a change; it fell under the purview of Parliament.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'Recognition of Mrs Bellinger as female for the purposes of section 11(c) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 would necessitate giving the expressions ‘male’ and ‘female’ in that Act a novel, extended meaning: that a person may be born with one sex but later become, or become regarded as, a person of the opposite sex.'

However, the Home Secretary decided not to implement the new scheme at all.<br>• The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) sought judicial review, arguing that the Home Secretary's decision was unlawful as it frustrated the intention of Parliament.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The FBU argued that the Home Secretary was under a legal duty to implement the statutory scheme, even if there was no specified date in the Act for its implementation.<br>• The Home Secretary argued that, in the absence of a specified date, it was for the executive to decide when, if ever, to implement the statutory scheme.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The House of Lords held, by a majority, that the Home Secretary had acted unlawfully in refusing to implement the statutory scheme.<br>• The court relied on the principle established in Padfield v.

The effect of that designation is that, whatever benefits might be perceived or suggested for any individual patients, if these particular drugs were available for medical prescription and use (other than research), such individual benefits were and are in the legislator's view outweighed by disbenefits of strength sufficient in the national interest to require a general prohibition.'

There need not be foresight of coercion to commit crimes, although it is not easy to envisage circumstances in which a party might be coerced to act lawfully.

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The case Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 (HL) revolves around a dispute of a testamentary disposition made by Alexander Chalmers, who left his considerable estate to his wife. When the will was being contested, Browne, the solicitor, who prepared the will, testified that Chalmers was of sound mind. The plaintiff's counsel disputed that Browne committed a fraud in preparing the will but did not cross-examine him on his credibility.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue is whether it is mandatory to confront a witness with allegations of misconduct when attempting to impeach their credibility in cross-examination as part of the adversarial process in English law.<br>• The argument for Browne is that the court should require the opponents to cross-examine the witness on disputed issues of fact or credibility before impeaching the witness' credibility.<br>• The argument for Dunn is that the court should not require the opponents to cross-examine the witness on disputed issues of fact or credibility but can proceed to impeach the witness' credibility by introducing evidence that contradicts the witness.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Browne-Dunn rule was established: when a party seeks to impeach a witness' credibility based on conflicting evidence, proper notice of the issue must be given during cross-examination. If the adverse party seeks to present evidence contradicting a witness, they must give the witness the opportunity to address the issue during cross-examination.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• '...it seems to me to be absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a case, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made...'

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• In Cox v Ministry of Justice [2016] UKSC 10, the claimant, Mrs. Cox, was a catering manager at a prison, working under the Ministry of Justice. <br>• During the course of her work, she sustained an injury when a sack of rice fell onto her, leading to her suffering a back injury. <br>• The sack was being carried by a prisoner who was working in the kitchen as part of a prison work program. <br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The key legal issue in this case was whether the Ministry of Justice could be held vicariously liable for the tortious acts of the prisoner (negligence). <br>• The Ministry of Justice argued that there was no vicarious liability, as there was no employment relationship between them and the prisoner. <br>• On the other hand, Mrs. Cox argued that the prison context and relationship was sufficient to establish vicarious liability. <br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court held that the Ministry of Justice was vicariously liable for the prisoner's negligence. <br>• In reaching this decision, the court applied the two-stage test for vicarious liability established in Catholic Child Welfare Society v Various Claimants [2012] UKSC 56 (CCWS):<br>  1. Is there a relationship between the defendant (Ministry of Justice) and the tortfeasor (prisoner) that is capable of giving rise to vicarious liability? <br>  2. Is there a sufficiently 'close connection' between the relationship and the tortious act?<br>• The court concluded that both elements were satisfied and therefore, the Ministry of Justice was vicariously liable. <br><br><strong>Key passage</strong><br>• 'In the present case, the requirements laid down in the Christian Brothers case are met. The prison service carries on activities in furtherance of its aims. … Prisoners working in the prison kitchens, such as Mr Inder, are integrated into the operation of the prison, so that the activities assigned to them by the prison service form an integral part of the activities which it carries on in the furtherance of its aims: in particular, the activity of providing meals for prisoners. They are placed by the prison service in a position where there is a risk that they may commit a variety of negligent acts within the field of activities assigned to them. That is recognised by the health and safety training which they receive. Furthermore, they work under the direction of prison staff. Mrs Cox was injured as a result of negligence by Mr Inder in carrying on the activities assigned to him. The prison service is therefore vicariously liable to her.' (Lord Reed at para. 32)"

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The case concerns alleged acts of sexual and physical abuse of children by members of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools between 1952-1992 at St Williams, a residential institution for boys.<br>• The Institute did not own the school and had no direct contractual relationships with the brothers who taught there.<br>• Claims were brought by 170 men against both the managers of the school (the Middlesbrough Defendants) and members of the Institute (the Institute Defendants).<br>• The High Court and the Court of Appeal held that the Institute Defendants were not vicariously liable for the acts of abuse committed by the brothers at the School.<br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The Middlesbrough Defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Institute Defendants should share vicarious liability for sexual abuse committed by the brothers.<br>• The Institute Defendants contended that the absence of a contractual relationship with the brothers meant that they could not be vicariously liable.<br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, finding that it was fair, just, and reasonable for the Institute Defendants to share vicarious liability with the Middlesbrough Defendants.<br>• The Court held that the relationship between the Institute and the teaching brothers had all of the essential elements of that between employer and employee, and thus the first stage of the test for vicarious liability was satisfied.<br>• The Court also found the necessary close connection between the relationship and the wrongdoer was established, as the Institute's relationship with the abusers put it in a position to use them to carry on its business in a way that created or significantly enhanced the risk of abuse."

Lord Hoffmann held that the actual decision in Cocks v. Thanet District Council [1983] 2 AC 286 showed no private law action could be pursued in these circumstances. <br>• Furthermore, Lord Hoffmann found it implausible that Parliament intended to embed one temporary duty enforceable by a private action in tort within an Act imposing various other important duties that were only enforceable in public law.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• Lord Hoffmann: 'In principle and on the authority of the actual decision of this House in Cocks v.

Nothing in his basis of plea hints at a potential legal difficulty with the plea to blackmail. The essential problem in this case is the relevance to the conviction, if any, of section 76 of the 2003 Act, and the conclusive presumptions which it provides in relation to consent in sexual cases.' (Rix LJ) <br>• 'She was not deceived as to the nature or purpose of intercourse, but deceived as to the situation in which she found herself. In our judgment the conclusive presumption in section 76 (2)(a) had no application, and counsel for the appellant below were wrong to advise on the basis that it did. However that is not an end of the matter.' (Rix LJ)"

			"summary": "<strong>Facts:</strong><br>• Two appellants were charged with attempting to convert criminal property (scrap metal) by accepting and processing it for onward sale, knowing or suspecting that it represented proceeds of criminal conduct.<br>• They argued that the applicable mens rea for the offences of attempt was not suspicion, but the judge found against them. <br><br><strong>Issues:</strong><br>• The principal issue was the mental element required for criminal attempt - whether suspicion was sufficient or if a higher level of intent was required. <br><br><strong>Decision:</strong><br>• The appeals were allowed. The court held that proof of suspicion was not sufficient for a count of attempted money laundering.<br>• The mental element required for attempt was the same as that for the substantive offence, meaning an intent to convert criminal property. <br><br><strong>Key passage(s):</strong><br>• 'A constituent element of the offence of converting criminal property is, as we have said, that the property in question is criminal property. That is an essential part of the offence. Accordingly, an intent to commit the offence involves, in the present case, an intent to convert criminal property: and that connotes an intent that the property should be criminal property... The Crown seeks to make it a criminal offence to intend to convert property suspecting, if not knowing, that it is stolen. But that is not what s.327, read with s.340(3), provides.'

Where in a given case both defences are potentially available, on the facts, then a judge should seek to adopt one to the exclusion of the other. In the present case, the more apposite defence, on the facts, on count 3 (and especially given the presence on the indictment of the count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm) was self-defence.'<br>• Lord Justice Davis: 'Thus our overall conclusion on the main question raised by this case is that, while it is likely to be a rare case on the facts where self-defence is even capable of arising with regard to a count of dangerous (or careless) driving, such defence is in principle capable as a matter of law of being available on such a count. All, ultimately, will depend on the use of force involved in the driving by reference to the particular circumstances of the case.'"

Whether the provisions of the conveyance should be construed as a covenant or the creation of an easement.<br>2. Whether it is possible to create a fencing easement by express grant.<br><br><strong>Decision:</strong><br>• The Court of Appeal held that the conveyance constituted a covenant, not an easement.<br>• They found that it is possible to create a fencing easement by express grant, but did not fully address this issue as it was not essential to the outcome of the appeal.<br>• The court concluded that the Golf Club is under a positive obligation to erect and maintain a fence along the boundary with Mr Haddock's property as stated in the conveyance.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s):</strong><br>• Lord Justice Patten: 'It seems to me that it is now sufficiently established - or at any rate, if not established hitherto, we should now declare - that a right to have our neighbour keep up the fences is a right in the nature of an easement which is capable of being granted by law so as to run with the land and to be binding on successors.'"

The covenant to fence did not demonstrate an intention that the right of way over the Strip should be extinguished. <br>• Moreover, in my judgment, if Summerhill and the Strip were again to be united under one owner (as is now possible as they are owned by husband and wife), the right of way enjoyed before the Transfer would become exercisable for the same purposes as it could be exercised before the Transfer: the owner of Summerhill could therefore use the Strip to reach the access way.

They claimed they were under real Lawful Act Economic Duress due to PIAC’s threats against their business.<br>• PIAC, the Respondent, proclaimed they acted on their genuine belief that the commission was not owed to TT, and that their proposed termination and cuts were not carried out in bad faith.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court judged in favour of PIAC. The decision ruled that the threat was not illegitimate, implying that TT cannot rescind the New Agreement under the principle of Lawful Act Economic Duress.<br>• PIAC's threat of terminating their contract and reducing TT's ticket allocation was not considered reprehensible conduct under case law and because PIAC genuinely believed they were not liable to pay the disputed commission, their behaviour was not considered reprehensible."

If the law required training or supervision in this case, it would equally be required for a multitude of other commonplace leisure activities which nevertheless carry with them a degree of obvious inherent risk... It makes no difference to this analysis that the appellants charged Mr Poppleton to use the climbing wall, nor that the rules which they displayed could have been more prominent.'(<br>Lord Justice May)<br>• 'But the balance between risk on the one hand and individual autonomy on the other is not a matter of expert opinion.

He had previously received interim payments of £450,000.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The key issue in the appeal was the correct approach to making an interim payment in a personal injury claim. The defendant submitted that the judge wrongly approved of a substantial interim payment, arguing it was beyond his jurisdiction and violated established practice.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court of Appeal determined that the judge erred in his approach. The court concluded the judge didn't properly assess the likely amount of final judgment nor did he comply with the provision that the court must not order an interim payment of more than a reasonable proportion of the likely amount of the final judgment.<br>• Consequently, it was held that an interim payment request of £1.2 million should be refused.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'The judge's first task is to assess the likely amount of the final judgment, leaving out of account the heads of future loss which the trial judge might wish to deal with by PPO... The interim payment will be a reasonable proportion of that assessment. A reasonable proportion may well be a high proportion, provided that the assessment has been conservative.' - Lady Justice Smith"

Mr Molyneaux refused and asserted adverse possession.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Could the Smiths prove that they gave Mr Molyneaux permissible to occupy the Property, which would invalidate his claim of adverse possession?<br>• The Smiths contended that undocumented arrangements and conversations, as well as the continued occupancy of other individuals on the land, constituted an implied licence.<br>• Mr Molyneaux argued no formal or explicit permission was given by the Smiths, and therefore he had a claim of adverse possession.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Privy Council decided that the Smiths had given Mr Molyneaux permissible to occupy the Property, therefore his claim of adverse possession was invalidated.

In the words of James, L.J., in Dunkirk Colliery Company v. Lever ( 9 Ch. Div. 25), “The person who has broken the contract” is not to be “exposed to additional cost by reason of the plaintiffs not having done what they ought to have done as reasonable men, and the plaintiffs” are not to be “under any obligation to do anything otherwise than in the ordinary course of business.”' - Lord Chancellor (Haldane)<br>'For the reasons which I have given, I think that the questions of law stated by the arbitrator in the special case have been wrongfully answered by the courts below. The result is that the award cannot stand and must be sent back to the arbitrator with a declaration that the contention of the appellants on the first question so far, but only so far, as they contended that the several facts relied upon by them were relevant matter to be considered by the arbitrator in assessing the damages, was right, and that of the respondents on the second question was wrong.' - Lord Chancellor (Haldane)"

It is, to quote Geoffrey Lane L.J., a letter setting out the financial terms on which it may be the council will be prepared to consider a sale and purchase in due course.'<br>• He also wrote: 'If the final sentence had been omitted the wording of the second paragraph, unlike that of the first, with its use of the indicative mood in such expressions as 'the interest rate will change', might have been understood by council tenants to whom it was addressed as indicating a firm offer of a mortgage of the amount and on the terms for repayment stated if the council were prepared to sell the house at the stated price. But whether or not this be the explanation of the presence of the last sentence in paragraph 2, it cannot possibly affect the plain meaning of the words used in paragraph 1.'"

The Secretary of State argued that a repeated claim doesn't fall within section 92(4)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.<br>• Further, the Secretary argued that BA's and PE's cases weren't advanced as 'fresh claims', thus they can be considered only out of the country and that there are no obstacles to the deportations.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Secretary of State's appeal was rejected by a majority of four to one.

Despite owning a property in England, they spent most of their married life in Nigeria.<br>• They separated in 1999 with Mrs. Agbaje staying in their English property. Divorce proceedings were issued in Nigeria, where Mrs. Agbaje was granted a life interest in a Lagos property and approximately £21,000.<br>• Utilising Part III of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, Mrs. Agbaje sought financial relief in England. She was initially granted approximately £275,000 (65% of the sale proceeds of the English property), providing she relinquished her Lagos property.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The Court of Appeal overturned the initial financial relief, stating the case's strong connection to Nigeria was not adequately considered by the High Court.<br>• At issue in the Supreme Court was the interpretation of applications made under Part III of the Act and how the court should consider such applications.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court allowed Mrs. Agbaje's appeal, restoring the High Court's order.<br>• It was declared that the purpose of Part III was to alleviate adverse consequences of inadequate financial provision by a foreign court when parties have substantial connections with England.<br>• The Court also held that it is not about deciding if an order should have been made by an English or foreign court, but rather providing relief where there have already been foreign proceedings.<br>• The Court established three principles to apply when deciding on financial provision under Part III, which include prioritizing children's welfare, not exceeding what would be awarded in English proceedings and provision for reasonable needs of each spouse."

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The appellant, Bocardo, is the freehold owner of the Oxsted Estate, Surrey, which contains an oil field.<br>• Star Energy was granted a license by the Crown to search and extract petroleum from the Oxsted Estate.<br>• Star Energy drilled diagonally through Bocardo's estate without causing any harm or interference to Bocardo's land.<br>• Star Energy did not negotiate any contractual licence from Bocardo and did not seek any statutory right to drill.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The trespass issue: whether the drilling of wells under Bocardo's estate by Star Energy constituted actionable trespass. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal affirmed that it was.<br>• The damages issue: determining the measure of damages if there was an actionable trespass. The High Court's measure was rejected by the Court of Appeal, which reduced the damages greatly.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the respondents’ cross-appeal on the trespass issue and, by a majority, dismissed Bocardo’s appeal on the damages issue.<br>• It held that Bocardo's title to the land extended to the subsurface strata and Star Energy's drilling constituted a trespass.<br>• However, in terms of damages, Lord Brown applied the compulsory purchase principles to the construction of the application of section 8(2) of the 1966 Act and concluded that the valuation should be based on what the grantor is losing rather than what the grantee is gaining.<br>• He further determined that any premium value of the ancillary right required by Star Energy fell under the 'no-scheme rule' and should be disregarded in determining the compensation."

The Appellant contested against his conviction, relying on the ECHR law, while the Respondent argued that Scotland's legal system provided a fair trial, despite the lack of access to a lawyer.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal, agreeing that access to a lawyer prior to questioning was a fundamental right protected by the ECHR. The justices referred to the Salduz v Turkey case precedent and disagreed with the respondend that the Scottish legal system, despite its advantages, made the violation permissible. Exceptions to right of access to legal advice before questioning only applied in compelling circumstances, not allowing systematic departure from the rule."

The tenant disputed this price, leading to a termination of the option contract by the landlord.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The tenant argued that the full market value, as given in the lease, pertained to the property's value as 'agricultural land or open space suitable for development as a golf course', not accounting for its potential for residential development, thereby overstating the option price.<br>• In response, the landlord insisted that 'full market value' meant the land's broad potential for development, housing included.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal.

DCC argued for an overall debit, which would reduce their group's overall tax bill.<br>• The parties agreed the second loan relationship created a credit of £1.8m to DCC, but disagreed on the first loan relationship credit (interest on the gilts received by DCC) and the third loan relationship debit (payment of 'deemed manufactured interest' deemed to have been made by DCC).<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal but differed in their reasoning compared to the Court of Appeal.<br>• Under an accrual basis of accounting, they held the credit in respect of interest on the gilts to be £2.9m, and the debit concerning deemed manufactured interest payment by DCC was also £2.9m.

This provision draws from Article 14(6) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966, which the UK ratified in May 1976.<br>• The key issue in this case was the definition of 'miscarriage of justice' in the context of compensation.<br>• The appellants in this case were seeking compensation after their murder convictions were quashed. In each case, the claim was refused; it was not evidenced that a 'miscarriage of justice' occurred.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The crux of this case lies in the interpretation of 'miscarriage of justice' and whether compensation should be administered only if the person was proven to be definitely innocent.<br>• The court defined four potential categories of miscarriage of justice. However, the matter required a more robust determination.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal of Mr Adams unanimously but allowed the appeals of Mr MacDermott and Mr McCartney by majority.<br>• The majority held that a 'miscarriage of justice' for the purpose of s 133 occurs when a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that the evidence against a defendant is so undermined that no conviction could possibly be based on it.<br>• A generous interpretation was given to 'new or newly discovered fact', inclusive of facts the significance of which were not appreciated during the trial.<br>"

(2) If not, are they money purchase benefits to the extent that they are attributable to contributions and credits not allocated to the GIF? (3) Are pensions granted by way of internal annuities money purchase benefits?<br>• The Secretary of State argued that money purchase schemes should always be fully funded, with no risk of the assets being insufficient to meet the liabilities.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• By a 4-1 majority, the Supreme Court dismissed the Secretary of State's appeal on the first and third issues. They held that equilibrium of assets and liabilities is not a requirement of the statutory definition of a money purchase scheme (and similarly for money purchase benefits).<br>• On the first issue, they disagreed with the KPMG [2006] 1 WLR 97 interpretation that ‘calculated by reference to’ means ‘calculated only by reference to’. They found the GIF mechanism did not unhitch a member's benefits from their total contributions.<br>• On the third issue, they found internal annuities are compatible with money purchase benefits and the method used to convert the lump sum into an annuity didn’t take the benefits outside of the ‘money purchase benefits’ definition.<br>• The second issue did not arise."

However, the Secretary of State served a notice of her removal to Ethiopia where she feared persecution.<br>• The Appellant sought judicial review arguing that she cannot be removed to Ethiopia under the protection of Article 32 of the Refugee Convention.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue was whether Article 32's protection extended to refugees who didn't have a right to stay in the hosting state, and whether 'lawfully present in the territory' implied just being tolerated in the territory.<br>• The Appellant argued that since she was recognised as a refugee, she should have the full protection of the Convention and cannot be removed to a third country that could not extend those rights.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, stating that Article 32 applies only to a refugee who has been lawfully admitted to stay in the contracting state.<br>• The decision clarified that 'lawfully' in Article 32 of the Convention referred to what is lawful according to the domestic laws of the hosting state, not on how a refugee is practically treated.<br>• They ruled that the Appellant's rights in a third country she may be expelled to, cannot have bearing on whether she is lawfully present in the hosting state.<br>"

These applications were refused.<br>• The Secretary of State's policies regarding granting concessions outside the immigration rules were not laid before Parliament.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The key issue was whether the Secretary of State's policies regarding granting concessions amounted to statements as to 'the practice to be followed' under section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971.<br>• The Secretary of State argued that concessionary policies, such as the Deportation Policy 5/96 (DP5/96), are exercises of the Royal prerogative and should not have to be laid before Parliament.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeals. They held that the power to make immigration rules is derived from the Act itself and is not an exercise of the Royal prerogative.<br>• DP5/96 was judged not to be a rule as defined under section 3(2) of the Act, as it was a flexible statement which may grant concessions depending on the circumstances of the case. Therefore, the Secretary of State did not have to lay it before Parliament."

Contrarily, the appellants argued it began following the reduced fine appeal. <br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, stating the limitation period sufficiently clear, precise, and foreseeable, and began from the expiry of the time in which the respondents could appeal against the Commission's infringement decision. <br>• The Court differentiated between infringement decisions and penalty decisions, asserting only the former could commence the limitation period. <br>• European law did not necessitate the existence of a power to extend the time for commencing damages claims.

However, the High Court ruled that a likelihood of harm could only be established by facts proven on the balance of probabilities, not mere possibilities.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the local authority's appeal, emphasizing that factual bases need to be established for projecting future harm, not suspicions or possibilities.<br>• The court noted that the real possibility that JJ was a past perpetrator was not enough by itself to establish future harm to the children currently in her care.<br>• While there were other potentially relevant facts from the earliercase against JJ—such as collusion, failure to protect T-J, deliberate neglect—they were not invoked by the local authority in the current case.<br>• The court decided it would not be fair to prolong proceedings, especially when JJ had been caring for the three children without noted concerns.<br>• The decision underlines the court's emphasis on proven facts and provides clarity on the interpretation of the threshold criteria under section 31(2)."

It ruled that such detention remained lawful until the Board directed release.<br>• The Court held that delays violating Article 5(4) should result in the award of damages.<br>•  It ruled that Mr Faulkner's damages be reduced to £6,500 and dismissed his cross-appeal.

This inadequate deliberation, keeping in mind it must be sufficiently serious to amount a breach of fiduciary duty, allows for court intervention.<br>• The Court also ruled that trustees seeking and following advice cannot be strictly held liable if this advice proves to be wrong.<br>• For a transaction to be set aside on grounds of mistake, the mistake must be causative and of adequate gravity.

Teal argued that they can present the US/Canadian claims first and then, when the 'PI Tower' cover is exhausted, recover the non-US/Canadian claims under the 'top and drop' policy.<br>• The Court of Appeal held the claims should be met in the order that BV's liabilities and expenses were ascertained. Teal appealed this decision.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br> • The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Teal's appeal. The Court stated that the ascertainment by agreement, judgement or award of the insured’s liability to a third party, or the incurring by the insured of expenses, exhausts the policy cover either entirely or pro tanto.<br>• The Court rejected Teal's proposal of adjusting claim priorities, stating that even the term 'paid' in the policy doesn't require BV to make monetary disbursements, but is rather a measure of liability incurred.<br>• The Court held that under the terms of all policies in question, claims must be met in the order that BV incurred ascertained expenses or third party liability up to the policy limit."

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The appellant, Mrs Pallikaropoulos, led a campaign against a permit granted by the Environment Agency for using shredded tyres as fuel in a cement works. <br>• After losing in the Court of Appeal, Mrs Pallikaropoulos was given leave to appeal to the House of Lords where she raised issues about the prohibitive cost of proceedings.<br>• The House of Lords ordered Pallikaropoulos to pay the Respondents' costs. <br>• The Supreme Court was established and had jurisdiction over the case.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The central issue in both appeals was the interpretation of 'prohibitively expensive' under the Aarhus Convention and how costs in environmental cases should be handled.<br>• The primary argument levied by the appellant was that the proceedings should not be prohibitively expensive in accordance with the Aarhus Convention.<br>• The Respondents argued that they should be awarded the costs of the appeal to the House of Lords.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• Initially, the Supreme Court set aside the cost officers' position to implement the Directives of the Aarhus Convention but referred the case to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling.<br>• Following the CJEU's decision, the Supreme Court made an order for costs in the amount of £25,000 in favour of the respondents. <br>• The Court ruled that it could not be said that the figure of £25,000 was 'unreasonably high' either on its own or in conjunction with the £2,000 awarded. The court followed guidance provided by the CJEU pertaining to the definition of 'not prohibitively expensive'."

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The appeal focuses on the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 designed to address 'entrapped patients'.<br>• The appellant, G, was detained at the state hospital at Carstairs under a 'compulsion order' and a 'restriction order' after being tried for rape, assault, and breach of the peace in 1998 and acquitted on the grounds of insanity.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• G argues that the tribunal failed to exercise its discretion in line with section 264, incorrectly weighed the risk he posed to women, gave undue weight to the non-availability of suitable resources elsewhere, failed to consider his wishes and feelings, and mistakenly prioritised the provision of maximum benefit over the least restrictive alternative principle.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The UK Supreme Court dismisses the appeal. The judgment argues that section 264(2) offers a residual discretion not limited to exceptional cases, that risk is relevant at both stages of the decision-making process, that comparative quality of treatment at other hospitals is relevant, that G's wishes and feelings were implicitly considered, and that the tribunal's conclusion for G to remain in the State Hospital was reasonable."

Additionally, they contended that gross misconduct, warranting dismissal, was not substantiated by the case investigator's report. <br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favour of Chhabra. <br>• They found the Trust had mishandled the investigation, failing to respect the distinct roles of the case investigator and case manager. <br>• The court deemed the involvement of Mr. Wishart, despite a contractual obligation for him not to participate, as a significant breach of contract. <br>• Additionally, it was ruled that the Trust failed to provide sufficient evidence to categorise Chhabra's conduct as gross misconduct, thereby making the disciplinary proceedings unlawful."

The Court of Appeal assessed capacity based on what the more complicated claim could have been. <br>• The High Court ruled the lack of capacity rendered the settlement void as it wasn't approved by the court, a requirement of Part 21.10 of the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR).<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeals. <br>• They decided that capacity must be judged in relation to the activity in question, not globally. Capacity for proceedings under the CPR is to conduct the claim based on the plaintiff's actual cause of action, regardless of how it is framed by their lawyers. <br>• As Ms Dunhill lacked this capacity, the settlement was considered void as it was made without a litigation friend to ensure its propriety as required by CPR 21.10.<br>• Therefore, the case must proceed to trial because Ms Dunhill, as a protected party, deserves protection both from herself and her legal advisors."

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• British Telecommunications Plc (BT) proposed a revised scheme of termination charges levied on mobile network operators for routing calls to BT's fixed lines.<br>• The defining characteristic was the variable-rate charges - higher charges for the caller would imply greater termination charges.<br>• The scheme was rejected by the four mobile operators involved in the appeal.<br>• The issue was referred to Ofcom under a statutory dispute resolution procedure.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Ofcom denied BT the right to introduce the new rates as they deemed them not 'fair and reasonable', based mainly on the welfare test.<br>• The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) overturned the decision, stating BT could implement the regime.<br>• The Court of Appeal restored Ofcom's initial verdict.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal and restored the CAT's order.<br>• The Court noted Ofcom's role to resolve disputes and regulate, with the contract's terms as the starting point.<br>• The Supreme Court emphasised that a rejection of charges should only occur if they'd exceed regulatory goals or are conclusively believed to impact consumers adversely. This wasn't the case in this scenario.<br>• The Supreme Court disagreed with the Court of Appeal on the point that a restriction on BT's price-setting freedom would distort competition.<br>• Consequently, the Supreme Court deemed the imposition of regulatory controls unnecessary since BT had no significant market power to unleash competition."

Key questions included: reference group for vulnerability determination; the relevance of family support to vulnerability assessment; and impact of the public sector equality duty under the Equality Act 2010 on the determination of priority need.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court, in a majority decision, clarified the definition of 'vulnerability'.<br>• The vulnerability of an applicant should be determined relatively, where the applicant must be significantly more vulnerable than an ordinary person in need of accommodation.<br>• It held that support from family members should not be ignored while assessing vulnerability.<br>• The Court also emphasised that equality duty should be properly considered in the housing allocation process. Lady Hale differed on the consideration of family support, holding it inconsistent with the Act's intention, yet the majority opinion prevailed."

It was the largest pay TV operator in Hong Kong by 2012. Although the service wasn't available in the UK, some Chinese-speakers residing there were aware of it through online platforms and exposure in Hong Kong.<br>• In 2012, PCCM launched an app named 'NOW player' in the UK, targeted at the Chinese-speaking population. Concurrently, British Sky Broadcasting Group announced the launch of their own IPTV service, also named 'NOW TV'. PCCM sued to prevent Sky from using the 'NOW TV' name under the doctrine of 'passing off'.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• PCCM claimed that Sky's use of the 'NOW TV' name amounted to passing off, arguing that they had a reputation in the UK amongst Chinese-speakers.<br>• Sky argued that for a passing off claim the plaintiff must have an actual customer base, or goodwill, within the jurisdiction of claim, and PCCM did not meet this criterion as they had no customers in the UK.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal, agreeing with Sky's line of argument regarding the territorial nature of goodwill in passing off cases.<br>• The court noted that PCCM's reputation in the UK was insufficient for a passing off claim as the company had no customers and therefore no goodwill in the UK.<br>• It concluded that while PCCM's programmes were accessible in the UK through websites, that did not establish a customer base as no payment was involved and the availability of such programmes was an attempt to promote their Hong Kong business, hence qualifying it as advertising, not trading, in the UK."

However, the Inner House of the Court of Session reversed that decision, initiating an argument about which parent's intention regarding residence is critical.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal.<br>• It noted that stability of residence is important for the purpose of habitual residence and there is no requirement for the child to be resident for a particular time or for there to be an intent to reside there indefinitely.<br>• It was determined that the children's habitual residence was Scotland as their life displayed the necessary quality of stability.

First was the timing of the council's decisions that appropriate assessment or EIA was not required, and the second was the relevance of mitigation measures intended to prevent adverse effects on the river.<br>• The appellant disputed the legality of the council's reliance on mitigation measures at the stage of granting planning permission to retrospectively dispense with the requirement for EIA.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong> <br>• The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal unanimously.<br>• The court ruled that the EIA should have been initiated right from the outset and the Council's delay in determining the necessity of EIA was legally defective. <br>• The Supreme Court indicated that there’s nothing to rule out consideration of mitigation measures at the EIA screening stage but such cases of material doubt should generally be resolved in favour of EIA. <br>• However, due to the absence of substantial prejudice, the procedural irregularity leading to the grant of planning permission was disregarded.<br>• The Court deemed that the appellant was able to enjoy the rights conferred by European legislation despite the legal defect in the procedure leading to the grant of planning permission."

Shahid sought orders declaring his segregation was in breach of the Prison Rules and violated articles 3 & 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The key matters for review were: whether the failure to comply with the time limits invalidated the continued segregation, whether Shahid's segregation breached article 3 of the Convention, and whether it violated article 8.<br>• The Scottish Ministers argued that the segregation pursued a legitimate aim, the protection of the appellant’s safety, and thus did not violate human rights.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal and declared that Shahid was segregated unlawfully during three separate periods totaling 14 months and his article 8 rights were violated.<br>• The court found that late permissions for segregation were invalid and segregation without valid authorisation was not in accordance with the law.<br>• The court also found that some decisions to segregate were not taken in the exercise of the independent judgment of Governors, but by the ECMDP, invalidating subsequent decision-making by the Ministers.<br>• However, it was decided that the conditions of segregation and measures imposed did not breach article 3.

The court stressed that urgent cases may need the jurisdiction of the courts in the country the child is present.<br>• The appeal was allowed, but the Supreme Court did not immediately grant the father’s request that Saleem be returned to Morocco; it ordered the case be returned to the High Court for a decision as to whether it is appropriate to exercise its Article 11 jurisdiction."

A part of this sum considering Value Added Tax (VAT) as being 'obtained' appeared to lead to a double recovery by the government.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The appellant argued that including VAT in the confiscation order constituted an unacceptable degree of double counting as VAT had already been accounted for to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).<br>• The Crown represented that any benefit 'obtained', even if accounted for to a third party, should be considered under POCA.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court, by a majority of 3:2, allowed Mr Harvey's appeal.<br>• It was determined that where VAT has been accounted for to HMRC, it would be disproportionate to consider it as a 'benefit obtained' under POCA per Article 1 Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<br>• The Court clarified that the VAT not accounted for to HMRC did not fall under this decision."

The Commencement Order was lawfully set up. <br>• The sentencing powers of a judge remained within the statutory maximum, and this had not changed within the CJA 2003 to the LASPO hence there was no violation of Article 7 ECHR. <br>• The introduction of the LASPO and its phased implementation was justified, dismissing the claim it was a breach of Article 14 ECHR."

They argued that foreign states could conceivably suffer a 'reputational disadvantage' if the suit were to proceed.<br>• The High Court ruled differently for the two cases. In Belhaj's case, it rejected the state immunity argument but accepted the 'foreign act of state' argument. In Rahmatullah's case, it rejected both arguments.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeals filed by the Government.<br>• The Court concluded that neither state immunity nor the 'foreign act of state' doctrine should serve as barriers to the claims of the respondents. This was because neither concept could cover the supposed 'reputational disadvantage' suffered by foreign states. Furthermore, the 'foreign act of state' doctrine was deemed inapplicable because it failed to trump allegations of complicity in torture, unlawful detention and rendition.<br>• The Court, therefore, decided that the claims were indeed capable of being tried in English courts, permitting the cases to proceed to trial."

They argued for the 'reality principle' which suggests the property should be valued as it existed on the relevant date as opposed to the assumption that the property was in reasonable repair.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously allowed SJJM's appeal and restored the Upper Tribunal's ruling, which held that the property was undergoing major reconstruction.<br>• The court noted the 'reality principle' continues to be a fundamental factor of rating valuation, and that the para 2(1)(b) of Schedule 6 did not replace this principle.<br>• The Court held that the VO should have made an objective assessment as to whether the property was undergoing reconstruction, and therefore incapable of beneficial occupation. If indeed redevelopment was occurring, then there was no basis to apply the para 2(1)(b) assumption to override the reality principle.<br>• The ruling clarified that a property's listing could be altered to 'building undergoing reconstruction' and consequently reduce the rateable value to a nominal amount if the facts support this alteration."

Investors claimed against the solicitors for failing to properly apply 'cover test' before releasing funds.<br>• The total claimed from the investors was over £10m. AIG looked to aggregate all claims into one under clause 2.5(a)(iv) of the Minimum Terms and Conditions (MTC).<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The primary issue arose under the interpretation of clause 2.5(a)(iv) of the MTC, determining whether the transactions between developers and investors were part of 'similar acts or omissions in a series of related matters or transactions'.<br>• AIG argued these were, the Commercial Court disagreed, ruling that the transactions were not mutually dependent. The Court of Appeal overturned this, stating the transactions were 'intrinsically' related.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court allowed AIG’s appeal. It decided that the transactions in each development scheme were related, therefore falls under 'a series of related transactions' and the claims from each development could be aggregated.<br>• However, transactions between the two different development projects weren't sufficiently related to be aggregated together. The claims of investors who transferred between the two projects were separable."

They declared that 'regularly' meant 'in accordance with the rules prescribed by the school'.<br>• Therefore, it was decided the initial penalty notice was correctly issued and Mr Platt should have been convicted, failing an established statutory exception.

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The appellant, a female prisoner, anticipated that upon release she would have to reside at a distant Approved Premises (AP) due to the limited number of APs for women. <br>• She brought proceedings claiming the provision of APs constituted sex discrimination, violating Equality Act 2010 and articles 8 and 14 of European Convention on Human Rights.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The appellant argued direct discrimination existed due to the disproportionate number and distribution of APs for women compared to men. <br>• The Secretary of State argued that the differences in AP provision were due to the smaller number of female offenders and the policy that all APs should be single sex.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appellant's appeal in part, declaring that the provision of APs constitutes direct discrimination against women which is unlawful unless justified. <br>• The decision was based on the Secretary of State failing to show justification for the discriminatory distribution of APs, which was likely to place women further from home than men. <br>• The court also noted that the authorities had breached the public sector equality duty by not having duly considered options for reducing this impact. <br>• It however kept room for justification to be shown in future individual cases."

Lady Hale and Lord Kerr dissented, arguing that the prevention and treatment of illness under section 1(1)(b) of the 2006 Act should not be geographically limited and that there was no legitimate aim to the interference with article 8."

It ruled that there was no 'unlawful act' as the current legislation could not be read in a way compatible with ECHR rights. <br>• However, if an individual victim did bring a case, the Court found the current law incompatible with Article 8 due to its blanket ban on abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, rape, and incest."

Warner's widow raised action against SFC, seeking damages for herself and their son, who was under legal disability due to his age.<br>• However, SFC lodged a defence that the action was time-barred under the Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea 1974.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The Athens Convention imposes a time bar of two years from the date on which the passenger would have disembarked, but rules are subject to the law of the case's court. The parties disagreed whether the Scots law of limitation enacted in section 18 of the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 ('the 1973 Act') could extend the limitation period.<br>• Mrs Warner maintained that Scots law contains 'grounds of suspension and interruption' of limitation periods under the Athens Convention. Conversely, SFC argued the 1973 Act's provision merely postponed the limitation period but didn't suspend or interrupt it.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses SFC's appeal. Indeed, the terms 'suspension' and 'interruption' are broad enough to cover domestic rules which postpone or stop the limitation period.<br>• The court ruled that Mrs Warner's claim as her son's guardian wasn't time-barred by the Athens Convention. Section 18 of the 1973 Act was acknowledged as having the effect of suspending the running of the limitation period under the Athens Convention."

He has scars which he asserts are the result of torture, but the Home Secretary’s argument is that they are self-inflicted by proxy ('SIBP'; inflicted by another person at KV's invitation). A medical expert, Dr Zapata-Bravo, stated his findings were 'highly consistent' with KV's account of torture.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The issue was the credibility of KV's claim. The Home Secretary claimed that Dr Zapata-Bravo had overstepped his professional bounds by stating his opinion concerning the overall consistency of his findings with KV's account of torture.<br>• The 'tribunal' still rejected KV's appeal citing clinical unlikelihood given the precision of KV's injuries and the likelihood of him remaining unconscious during their infliction without anaesthetics.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court allows the appeal unanimously, remitting KV's appeal against the refusal of asylum to the Upper Tribunal for a fresh hearing. It concluded that decision-makers could legitimately receive assistance from medical experts able to offer an opinion about the consistency of their findings with the asylum-seeker's account about the circumstances in which the scarring was sustained.<br>• It also highlighted that the tribunal notably failed to take into account the fact that self-infliction of wounds is inherently unlikely and suggested that very considerable weight should be given to the fact that injuries which are SIBP are likely to be extremely rare."

A deportation order was issued in July 2013.<br>• The Appellant made further submissions alluding to Article 8 of ECHR when his partner was pregnant. After the birth of his child, he provided more submissions with related documentation.<br>• All submissions were rejected by the Secretary of State, who decided they did not amount to a 'fresh claim' under Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong>:<br>• The question for the court was whether the new submissions should be treated as fresh claims, thus attracting the right of appeal under Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act).<br>• The Appellant argued that the identification of further submissions as a fresh claim was not necessary for the claim to be appealable, referencing BA (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] UKSC 7 and the 2014 Amendments to the 2002 Act.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong>:<br>• The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. The judgment, delivered by Lord Lloyd-Jones, indicated the claims made by the Appellant were factored into the decision-making process but did not invoke a fresh right of appeal.<br>• 'BA (Nigeria)' was found to apply to cases where the submissions had already been rejected and no longer concerning the issue of whether there was a claim needing a decision.<br>• There was no indication that Parliament intended the 2002 Act to provide a comprehensive code for dealing with repeat claims, rendering Rule 353 irrelevant. The 2014 Amendments to the 2002 Act were not seen to have fundamentally changed the statutory scheme.<br>• Thus, the 'human rights claim' in Section 82 of the 2002 Act only meant an original or a fresh claim under Rule 353, hence the Appellant's further submissions did not amount to a fresh claim attracting an appeal right."

The High Court held that it was not 'yearly interest'. The Court of Appeal reversed this.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The central issue was the interpretation of 'yearly interest' in the Income Tax Act 2007.<br>• LBIE's administrators argued that statutory interest did not accrue over time before equalisation of the surplus and thus did not meet the requirement of 'yearly interest'.<br>• The HMRC argued that statutory interest is compensation for creditors and has a long-term quality, so qualifies as 'yearly interest'.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, agreeing with the Court of Appeal.<br>• They found that the 'yearly interest' under the Insolvency Rules 2016 is in line with the Income Tax Act 2007.<br>• The statutory interest was considered compensation for creditors for deprivation of their money during administration, just like in previous decisions concerning trusts and personal injury cases.<br>• Hence, it was concluded that income tax must be deducted prior to payment of statutory interest to creditors."

She subsequently applied to have herself and her four children treated as homeless as per Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 ('the 1996 Act').<br>• Birmingham City Council rejected her application, claiming that she was intentionally homeless as the West Bromwich property was affordable and reasonable for her to continue to occupy and that she had deliberately failed to pay the rent. <br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Ms Samuels challenged the council's decision, appealing to the County Court and then the Court of Appeal, both of which dismissed her claim.<br>• The key issue brought to the Supreme Court was whether the council had incorrectly deemed the prior accommodation as 'affordable'.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously quashed the council's decision. Lord Carnwath, delivering the judgment, stated that the local authority must account for all sources of income (including all social security benefits) and assess 'reasonable living expenses' objectively rather than subjectively.<br>• The Supreme Court criticized the 'flexibility' test the council had used, stating that the correct question was what her reasonable living expenses were, inclusive of her children's needs.<br>• It was suggested that the council made a decision on the Samuels' homelessness application considering the welfare of the children as required under the Children Act 1989."

They also debated whether charges payable to the salvors under the SCOPIC (Special Compensation, Protection and Indemnity) clause of Lloyd’s Open Form counted (Issue 2).<br><br><strong>Decision</strong>:<br>• The Supreme Court partially allowed the appeal.<br>• They sided with the ship owners on Issue (1), affirming that the cost of repairing the damage incorporated all reasonable costs of salvaging and protecting the Renos from the time of the casualty onwards and that these costs were not reduced by being incurred before the notice of abandonment.<br>• For Issue (2), the court ruled that SCOPIC charges were not part of the 'cost of repairing the damage' under section 60 (2)(ii) since they serve to protect an entirely different interest - the ship owner's potential liability for environmental pollution."

They made points on illegality, lack of causation, and a countervailing claim of deceit.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court of the UK unanimously dismissed Daiwa's appeal with Lady Hale delivering the primary judgment.<br>• Daiwa's defences were deemed invalid. The Quincecare duty is meant to protect the interests of the customer, and attributing the fraud to Singularis would not enhance the integrity of the law or be proportional to Singularis' wrongdoing.<br>• In response to Daiwa's argument of lack of causation, Dame Hale countered that the Quincecare duty exists to protect customers from harm caused by people they are responsible for, and the loss was indeed caused by Daiwa's breach of duty.<br>• Al Sanea's fraud was not attributed to Singularis for the purposes of the Quincecare duty claim.

The husband challenged the jurisdiction of English court for the maintenance order, which the English High Court denied.<br>• After a failed appeal to the Court of Appeal, the husband appealed to the Supreme Court on jurisdictional issues.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The husband argued the English court lacked jurisdiction due to the case's Scottish basis and the divorce proceedings in Scotland. <br>• The wife argued that the English court had jurisdiction under Section 27 for maintenance payments.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• By a majority, Supreme Court dismissed the husband's appeal.<br>• Primarily, the court pointed out EU legislation considered maintenance obligations and marital status as separate matters for jurisdiction.<br>• The court rejected the husband's interpretation of Section 27 which he argued only governed interstate cases.<br>• The court ruled that the Maintenance Regulation denies the discretion of courts to stay proceedings on 'forum non conveniens' grounds.<br>• The court agreed that the 2011 Regulations is within the Secretary of State’s powers via section 2(2) of the ECA 1972.<br>• The husband's divorce proceeding in Scotland was not a 'related action' by definition of the Maintenance Regulation. As such, the English court could not decline jurisdiction of the wife's maintenance claim under Section 27.<br>• In conclusion, the majority of the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's judgement that the English court has jurisdiction over the wife's maintenance claim despite the Scottish divorce proceedings."

The contract between them included an arbitration agreement for disputes to be arbitrated in London.<br>• Following the fire, Chubb Russia paid the insurance claim of the plant owner. Consequently, it assumed any rights of the owner to claim for damages from third parties, including Enka. Thus, Chubb Russia brought a claim against Enka in Russia.<br>• Enka contested this in the High Court in London, seeking an anti-suit injunction against Chubb Russia to stop its claims in Russia.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main dispute was about the governing law of the arbitration agreement when the law relating to the contract differed from the law of the seat of the arbitration. Chubb Russia argued that Russian law applies while Enka maintained that English law governs the arbitration agreement. <br>• The Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Enka, stating that in absence of an explicitly chosen law, the law of the seat (English law) governs.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court upheld the decision of Court of Appeal, albeit for different reasons.<br>• The majority held that in absence of express choice of law, the arbitration agreement is tied to the law of arbitration seat, English law in this case.<br>• They reasoned that the law that governs the arbitration agreement is either (i) the law chosen by the parties explicitly or implicitly, or if absent, (ii) the law most closely tied to the arbitration agreement.<br>• The Court also clarified that the injunction's appropriateness depends on if there was a breach of agreement, not on the arbitration agreement's governing law."

It ruled, albeit with different reasoning from lower courts, that no circumstances raised justifiable doubts about Mr Rokison's impartiality.<br>• The court acknowledged Mr Rokison's legal duty of disclosure and his breach of this duty in failing to disclose his appointment in subsequent references involving Chubb and Transocean, which could have suggested a real possibility of bias.<br>• However, considering circumstances known at first instance, the court found no real possibility of bias."

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• ]Ms Brazel, a music teacher employed by the Harpur Trust, only worked and was remunerated during term time. Her holiday pay was initially determined by multiplying her average week's pay by 5.6, as per section 224 of the Employment Rights Act 1996.<br>• The Harpur Trust changed this calculation method, paying her 12.07% of her pay for the term as holiday pay. As a result, her holiday pay decreased.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The Harpur Trust argued that the holiday pay of part-year workers should be pro-rated to reflect the actual work performed and align with the EU Working Time Directive.<br>• They also proposed two alternative calculation methods for holiday pay, asserting that while Ms Brazel benefited from the original method, other workers might be disadvantaged.<br>• Ms Brazel contended that under the domestic law and the Working Time Regulations 1998, her holiday pay should not be pro-rated.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the Harpur Trust's appeal.<br>• The court held that European law does not prevent more generous provisions than those prescribed by the EU Working Time Directive. Therefore, the holiday pay of part-year workers in the UK was not required to be pro-rated.<br>• The alternative calculation methods proposed by the Harpur Trust were found to be in direct contradiction to the statutory method set out in law, necessitate complex calculations, and were deemed unnecessary."

The Secretary of State refused her application on two grounds: that the loan from MAM did not result in her having the £1 million 'under her control' because she had no choice about where to invest the money and that the investment in Eclectic was not a qualifying investment due to it being an excluded form of company.<br>• This decision was contested, leading to a legal adjudication process where the interpretation of 'money under [her] control' within the immigration rules became the principal issue.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal and restored the Secretary of State's decision to refuse Ms Wang's application for leave to remain.<br>• The court agreed that 'under [her] control' required the applicant to have a real choice about the use and disposition of the relevant money. It was determined that Ms Wang did not have any real choice about the use of the loaned money due to the scheme's terms, commercial rationale, and practical operation.<br>• Consequently, the court concluded that the Secretary of State was right in his decision and that Ms Wang did not have the money 'under [her] control' for the purposes of the Immigration Rules."

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The appellant, a defendant in a personal injury case, fell 35 feet from a ramp and became seriously injured.<br>• The defendant admitted liability and was responsible for compensation.<br>• However, there was disagreement over the form the compensation should take, with the plaintiff arguing it should adjust in line with the Average Earnings Index (AEI) not the Retail Price Index (RPI).<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The issue centred around the interpretation of sections 2(8) and 2(9) of the Damages Act 1996.<br>• The claimant argued that section 2(8), dictating how amount varies by reference to the RPI, identified default position while section 2(9) allowed a court to make orders as it deemed just.<br>• The defense on the other hand, contended that 2(8) was usually applicable, with 2(9) only applicable under exceptional circumstances.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, siding with the claimant's interpretation of sections 2(8) and 2(9).<br>• The Court emphasised that there was nothing in the language of these sections to suggest that section 2(9) could only be triggered in exceptional cases.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'In my judgment this condition is not satisfied in the present case. If a periodical payments order does not identify on its face the manner in which the amount of the payments is to vary (in order to maintain their real value) then s 2(8) prescribes that it is to be treated as providing for what is set out in that sub-section unless the order contains provision of a type identified in s 2(9). There is nothing in the language of these sub-sections to suggest that the power to make provision such as identified in s 2(9) may only be triggered in an exceptional case' (Lord Justice Brooke).<br>• 'The Explanatory Notice is helpful in that it confirms that the principal purpose of these provisions is to achieve the aim identified by the former Lord Chancellor when he gave his reasons for setting the discount rate mentioned in s 1 of the 1996 Act at 2.5%' (Lord Justice Brooke)."

The risk of injury to the hearing of employees can be suitably reduced by ear muffs which leave them in comparative silence. But the employer provides muffs with radio equipment so that employees who so wish can also listen to music. The radio receivers are delicate and several break down, so that after a while the employer stops repairing them and leaves the employees in silence. Does he commit an offence under the regulations because he has failed to keep PPE in good repair? In my opinion this would be absurd. Regulation 7 cannot, by means of the repairing obligation, require the employer to provide equipment which he need not have provided in the first place.<br>• Baroness Hale of Richmond: 'Having provided the boots, 'every employer shall ensure that any personal protective equipment provided to his employees is maintained (including replaced or cleaned as appropriate) in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair': reg 7. This refers to 'any' personal protective equipment. It means the whole boot, not just the toe cap. It has to be kept 'in good repair'. I agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe that a boot with a hole in it is not in good repair. It is defective. On the face of it, the regulation has been broken.'"

They maintained that their only duty was to obtain the 'best price reasonably obtainable' at the date of sale.<br>• The legal question at hand is whether mortgage receivers have a duty to enhance the value of the property before sale.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. They held that the receivers, in exercising their power of sale, owed the same fiduciary duty as the mortgagee to the mortgagor.<br>• Their duty was to take reasonable care to obtain the best price 'reasonably obtainable' at the date of the sale. This fiduciary duty did not, however, extend to taking steps to increase the value of the property before sale.<br>• The court defined this fiduciary duty as primarily to secure repayment of the debt and the receivers were free to halt any investigative or enhancement steps and proceed with an immediate sale of the properties as they were.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• '...by accepting office as receivers of the Claimants' properties the Receivers assumed a fiduciary duty of care to the Bank, the Claimants and all (if any) others interested in the equity of redemption. ... The appointment of the Receivers as agents of the Claimants having regard to the special character of the agency does not affect the scope or the content of the fiduciary duty. The scope or content of the duty must depend on and reflect the special nature of the relationship between the Bank, the Claimants and the Receivers arising under the terms of the mortgages and the appointments of the Receivers, and in particular the role of the Receivers in securing repayment of the secured debt and the primacy of their obligations in this regard to the Bank.' - Mr Justice Lightman"

			"summary": "<strong>Facts:</strong><br>• Wijsmuller B.V. agreed with Lauritzen A/S to transport a drilling rig from Japan to the Rotterdam area on one of their vessels.<br>• The contract of carriage was governed by English law and contained a cancellation clause (clause 17).<br>• Super Servant Two, the intended vessel for the carriage, sank in the Zaire River.<br>• Wijsmuller informed Lauritzen that they could not perform the transportation with either Super Servant One or Two.<br>• The parties entered into negotiations and eventually agreed that the rig would be transported by barge and tug between July and October. Both parties suffered loss or increased expense as a result of this alternative method, leading to the current litigation.<br><br><strong>Issues:</strong><br>• The issues to be decided were:<br>• Whether Wijsmuller were entitled to cancel the contract under clause 17 if the loss of Super Servant Two was caused by their negligence.<br>• Whether the contract was frustrated by the loss of Super Servant Two and subsequent election by Wijsmuller to use Super Servant One on other voyages.<br><br><strong>Decision:</strong><br>• The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the judge at first instance.<br>• The court ruled that Wijsmuller were not entitled to cancel the contract under clause 17 if the loss of Super Servant Two was caused by their negligence.<br>• Additionally, the court held that the contract was not frustrated by the loss of Super Servant Two, as the defendants could have fulfilled their obligation by using Super Servant One.<br>• The court rejected the argument that an election made by the defendants to allocate their remaining means in a reasonable way could result in frustration of the contract.<br>• The court emphasized that frustration brings a contract to an end automatically and without the need for an election or decision by a party.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s):</strong><br>• 'If the sinking of the Super Servant Two in the Zaire River was due to 'perils or danger and accidents of the sea' within the meaning of clause 17 if the sinking occurred without the negligence of the defendants, it was equally, so far as the mere construction of these words is concerned, due to perils or danger and accidents of the sea if the sinking was caused by the negligence of the defendants.' - Lord Justice Dillon<br>• 'The contract contains in clause 16.1 an exceptions clause which clearly does, in my judgment, exempt the defendants, where it applies, from liability for their own negligence; it exempts from liability for any loss (direct or consequential) or damage to the cargo howsoever caused unless caused by the deliberate act or omission of the defendants. But it only applies to what happens during the voyage, i.e. from the start of the transportation of the rig to the actual location of loading to its transportation to the actual location of redelivery.' - Lord Justice Dillon"

There is surely no difficulty in recognising the co-existence in one transaction of legal and equitable rights and remedies: when the money is advanced, the lender acquires an equitable right to see that it is applied for the primary designated purpose (see Re Rogers (u.s.) where both Lindley L.J. and Kay L.J. explicitly recognised this):... I can appreciate no reason why the flexible interplay of law and equity cannot let in these practical arrange-ments, and other variations if desired : it would be to the discredit of both systems if they could not. In the present case the intention to create a secondary trust for the benefit of the lender, to arise if the primary trust, to pay the dividend, could not be carried out, is clear and I can find no reason why the law should not give effect to it.'

The father originally intended to make it a gift but it was argued that he hadn't completed all necessary steps for the transfer. <br>• The father's intended use for the property was for his terminally ill daughter but she declined the offer. <br>• The son offered to buy the house when the daughter declined but the father insisted no money was necessary. The contents of the document stated the sale as £9,000 for the transfer, purely to avoid Capital Gains Tax. <br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The son claimed since the signed agreement, he fully assumed the property ownership and insisted that title be transferred legally to his name. His father was reluctant. The son alleged undue influence in his pursuit to secure the title, something rejected by the presiding judge. <br>• The father, after a fallout with the son, refused to go any further with the title transfer. He also got possession of the Land Certificate again with help from another law firm.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The court held that the property was a gift to the son and that the father had done everything required to transfer the title. <br>• The legal responsibility to transfer the title to the Land Registry was with the son. <br>• The plaintiff's appeal was dismissed.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'In my judgment, that is the situation here. The father had done everything in his power to transfer the house to his son... In those circumstances, it seems to me that Mr. Nugee's judgment was correct and I would dismiss the appeal.' - LORD JUSTICE LAWTON<br>• 'In this case, the plaintiff executed a transfer and put it within the control of the defendant together with the Land Certificate.

The second claim was grounded on the fact that the beneficiaries under the pension schemes never undertook the risk that their pension funds would be misappropriated.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong>:<br>• Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, rejecting both grounds of BIM's claim for an equitable charge over MCC's assets.<br>• The court held that there was no evidence to conclude that the misappropriated moneys were intended to make good the funds of BIM.<br>• The court also rejected the wider interpretation of LOrd Templeman's observations in 'Space Investments' case.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong>:<br>• 'I therefore consider that the judge came to the right conclusion, though I do not accept that it is possible to trace through an overdrawn bank account or to trace misappropriated money into an asset bought before the money was received by the purchaser.

Target disputed this decision in the Court of Appeal and finally, in the Supreme Court. <br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Target argued that its services should be exempted under the financial services exemption as its instructions resulted in the automatic payment from borrowers to Shawbrook’s bank accounts via BACS (the “payments/transfers issue”).<br>• The crux of the dispute depends on whether the VAT exemption applies only to services that in themselves effect the transfer of funds and change the legal status of the parties (the 'narrow interpretation') or whether it is sufficient for them to have a causal effect (the 'wider interpretation').<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court dismissed Target's appeal, concluding that its loan administration services do not fall under the VAT exemption.<br>• The Supreme Court upheld a narrow interpretation of the VAT exemption (as validated by CJEU case law, such as SDC, Bookit II, NEC, and DPAS) concluding that to qualify for the financial services exemption, the services themself should effect the transfer of funds and change the legal and financial position. Just giving instructions can't avail the exemption.<br>• The Supreme Court found that the loan accounts’ entries were only a ledger of expected payments and did not effect payments or changes to the financial and legal situation thereby not qualifying for the exemption. <br>• Hence, it was unnecessary to consider any further issues arising since the court had rejected Target's two primary claims that its services should come under the financial services exemption."

When the plan failed because the independent directors of ENC imposed conditions on the use of company’s funds, a loss was incurred by the funds under Meridian's management.<br>• This led to an allegation of breach of regulatory requirements relating to immediate disclosure when a substantial interest is acquired in a company's shares based on the New Zealand Securities Amendment Act 1988.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue was the attribution of the knowledge of the investment managers to Meridian, thus invoking Meridian's obligation to disclose their substantial interest in ENC shares.<br>• The appellants argued that the responsibility and knowledge lay only with the board of the company or possibly with Mr. Armour, but certainly not with the investment managers.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The court found that upon proper construction of section 20(4)(e) of the Securities Amendment Act, a company knows that it has become a substantial security holder when that is known to the person who had the authority to do the deal.<br>• Therefore, under these circumstances, the knowledge of the investment managers was deemed the knowledge of Meridian.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'Their Lordships would therefore hold that upon the true construction of section 20(4)(e), the company knows that it has become a substantial security holder when that is known to the person who had authority to do the deal.' - Lord Hoffmann<br>• 'It was ... not necessary in this case to inquire into whether Koo could have been described in some more general sense as the 'directing mind and will' of the company. But their Lordships would wish to guard themselves against being understood to mean that whenever a servant of a company has authority to do an act on its behalf, knowledge of that act will for all purposes be attributed to the company. It is a question of construction in each case as to whether the particular rule requires that the knowledge that an act has been done, or the state of mind with which it was done, should be attributed to the company.' - Lord Hoffmann"

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• Berlinah Wallace was charged with the murder of Mark van Dongen, resulting from her throwing sulphuric acid on him.<br>• The acid attack caused Mr. van Dongen catastrophic injuries, leading to complete paralysis and unbearable pain.<br>• Mr. van Dongen later opted for voluntary euthanasia in Belgium, where it is legal, which was administered by doctors.<br>• The trial judge ruled that the voluntary euthanasia broke the chain of causation from the original acid attack, thereby absolving Wallace of murder.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The prosecution argued that the original attack remained a significant cause of death and that the intervening act of euthanasia did not break the chain of causation.<br>• Wallace's defense contended that the act of euthanasia, being independent and a product of Mr. van Dongen's autonomous decision, severed the chain causally linking her conduct to the death.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court of Appeal allowed the prosecution's appeal, ordering a retrial and establishing that Wallace's initial act could still be considered a significant cause of death.<br>• The issue of foreseeability, while not initially raised, was considered relevant to determining causation in the retrial.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'In the event we consider that the jury could conclude on the facts as they were here that the acts of Mr van Dongen and the doctors were not sensibly divisible; that the doctors' (lawful) conduct in carrying out with their hands what he could not carry out with his own was but one link in the chain of events instigated by the defendant and, notwithstanding the intervening act of Mr van Dongen and/or the doctors, the defendant's conduct could fairly be said to have made a significant contribution to Mr van Dongen's death. We have not lost sight of the issue of self-preservation and the fact that in none of the cases mentioned in Pagett was the victim's response one intended to bring about death (however grave the risk taken that it might do so). But in the light of the decision in Dear the seeking of death (suicide in that case) as a response to horrific injuries does not preclude the jury finding that the defendant's conduct made a significant contribution to Mr van Dongen's death.'"

The Court of Appeal required remission to the Chancery Division to determine whether Clause 9, on the true construction of the deed, was valid or void for uncertainty.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Appellants argued that the provisions of Clause 9 constituted a mandatory trust that required the trustees to distribute the income. <br>• Respondents contended that the deed provided for a power, not a trust, allowing trustees discretionary distribution of funds, resulting in less stringency for validating such a power.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The House of Lords held that the provisions of Clause 9(a) constituted a trust, not a mere power. <br>• The decision of the Court of Appeal was reversed and the case was remitted to the Chancery Division for further determination regarding the validity of Clause 9.<br>• The House of Lords also held that the test for the validity of a trust should be similar to that for powers; the trust is valid if it can be said with certainty whether any given individual is or is not a member of the class.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>'As a matter of reason, to hold that a principle of equal division applies to trusts such as the present is certainly paradoxical. Equal division is surely the last thing the settlor ever intended: equal division among all may, probably would, produce a result beneficial to none. Why suppose that the court would lend itself to a whimsical execution? and as regards authority, I do not find that the nature of the trust, and of the court's powers over trusts, calls for any such rigid rule. Equal division may be sensible and has been decreed, in cases of family trusts, for a limited class, here there is life in the maxim 'equality is equity,' but the cases provide numerous examples where this has not been so, and a different type of execution has been ordered, appropriate to the circumstances.' - (Lord Wilberforce)"

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• This case concerns an appeal against an alteration of Land Registry titles for a property in London. <br>• The Property was intended to be redeveloped into flats, but a series of events led to the freehold being acquired by a developer, Mr. Ralph, without payment to the original claimants. <br>• The top floor remained unconverted, and the claimants, Mr. Byrne and Mr. Briars, retained leases to parts of the roofspace, while Mr. Ralph, through a series of transactions, sought to take over the roofspace. <br>• Ralph used a planning application and claimed forfeiture due to unpaid ground rent to support his claim to the roofspace, leading to the registrar altering the titles accordingly. <br>• The claimants challenged the forfeited leases and sought rectification of the Register. <br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The claimants argued there was no effective forfeiture of their leases and sought rectification. <br>• The appellants contended that any rectification could not have retrospective effect and challenged the alteration of priorities. <br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The County Court decided in favour of the claimants, ordering the rectification of the Register by reinstating their titles with priority over the new lease. <br>• The appellate court dismissed arguments against retrospective effects, emphasizing changes in priority apply from the moment of rectification moving forward, not retrospectively. <br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'The Appellant's case has to be, and is, that the effect of the words 'for the future' is that if interest B has been registered after the mistake but before the rectification, and thus would otherwise enjoy priority, that priority cannot be altered: an alteration to a priority which already exists cannot be described as an alteration 'for the future'. But if that is right then their effect is to prevent the Court from changing priorities in the very situation which paragraph 8 is intended to address. There is no problem of competing priorities once the rectification has been achieved. The only priorities that could be changed relate, necessarily, to interests which have already been created.'

The answer to that question is in my judgment quite clear. Viewed as a matter of causation, the damage suffered by the claimant was not caused by his or their criminal activity.

In the light of our conclusion, however, it is unnecessary in this appeal to consider further the first claimant's arguments relating either to a novel tort or to conspiracy to injure by unlawful means.

I would conclude that the 1945 Act cannot, in principle, be used to reduce damages in cases where claims are based on assault and battery, despite the remarks in such cases as Lane v Holloway and Murphy v Culhane, which I would say are not binding on this court. Moreover, it seems to me that such a conclusion is in keeping with the purpose of the 1945 Act, as set out in section 1(1), which was to relieve claimants whose actions would previously have failed, not to reduce the damages which would have previously have been awarded to claimants.' - Lord Justice Aikens."

Mr. Best had lived in the property after this section came into force.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The Registrar (Appellant) argued that Mr. Best's possession, which constituted a criminal offence under section 144 LASPOA, should not count towards the period of adverse possession required for registration.<br>• Mr. Best (Respondent) argued that his adverse possession claim should still be valid despite the periods that involved criminal conduct under section 144 LASPOA.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The appeal was dismissed.<br>• The Court of Appeal supported the High Court's decision, holding that criminalisation under section 144 LASPOA doesn't affect the operation of the adverse possession rules in the LRA. <br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'In the circumstances, I consider that the true inference is that in enacting section 144 Parliament did not intend to produce any collateral effect upon the settled law of adverse possession in respect of either registered or unregistered land. ... That inference is further reinforced by the arbitrary effects that the Registrar's argument (if correct) would have upon the law of adverse possession. It would involve a capricious distinction between the rules of adverse possession affecting residential buildings and the rules affecting other forms of real property, with no good justification for such distinction. It would involve potentially wholly disproportionate and arbitrary impact for even very limited periods of breach of section 144 (perhaps lasting only a matter of days) upon periods of adverse possession lasting many years, or even decades.' - Lord Justice Sales.<br>• 'The subject matter is sufficient to exclude ex turpi causa in this instance. The provisions of schedule 6 of the LRA must be interpreted to give effect to that intention. Section 144 and schedule 6 operate independently of each other. Parliament's decision to enact section 144 in separate legislation reinforces this conclusion. The Registrar was right to raise the questions that he has done. But in my judgment, the ex turpi causa principle is excluded from schedule 6 of the LRA to the extent of any criminal conduct under section 144 of LASPOA.' - Lady Justice Arden."

Another issue was whether the presumption that encroachment accrues for the benefit of the landlord's title had been rebutted.<br>• Tickle contended that her use of the Fields was separate from her tenancy and that she rebutted the presumption of encroachment.<br>• Admiral Taverns argued that Tickle's use of the Fields was ancillary to the public house business and did not constitute a separate holding.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Adjudicator found that Tickle had established adverse possession for just over 12 years since March 1999.<br>• The presumption of encroachment was rebutted as the use of the Fields was separate from the tenancy, and both Tickle and the landlords had acted in a manner that reflected this separate use.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'In light of these findings of fact I conclude that the Applicant has rebutted the presumption of encroachment in respect of the Fields. I find on the evidence that neither the Applicant nor her various landlords intended her to occupy the Fields as part of her tenancy and that they conducted themselves so as to show that her encroachment on the Fields was for her own benefit rather than for the benefit of her respective landlord’s reversion.'<br>• 'To establish a claim based on estoppel the Respondent would need to be able to establish that it has relied on the representation alleged to its detriment. While the Respondent has identified its decision to take a transfer of the freehold as its reliance on clause 2.2 it cannot make out a relevant detriment. I have found above that the Respondent consistently conducted itself in a manner which demonstrated that it regarded the Applicant’s encroachment as being for the Applicant’s benefit. This was not least in its exclusion of the Fields from the demise plan in the 2009 tenancy agreement itself. In the circumstances the Application is consistent with the mutual understanding of the parties and the Respondent has not therefore suffered any detriment as a result of the Application.'"

This solution is in my opinion consistent with the ruling and rationale of McFarlane. The conventional award would not be, and would not be intended to be, compensatory.

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• During the national coal strike in July 1921, safety men at the collieries were pressed to join strikers. <br>• After a confrontation and picketing, safety men decided not to work due to insufficient police protection. <br>• A garrison of police was requested by the appellants' manager to maintain work safety. <br>• The police presence successfully allowed safety men to resume work and avoided the flooding of the colliery.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Appellants argued there was no consideration for the promise to pay for the police protection - it was part of the police's legal duty. <br>• Respondents (police) contended provision of a garrison was a 'special service' and not a duty. Hence, they could charge for it. <br>• Appellants insisted they were entitled to free protection from the police, and no special service was warranted.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court upheld the payment for police services as legal. <br>• It found the police garrison's services were beyond the scope of police obligations and were rightly chargeable as 'special services.' <br>• The Appeal was dismissed with costs.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• Viscount Finlay: '[...] It appears to me that there is nothing in the first point made for the colliery owners that there was no consideration for the promise.

If one party to a contract repudiates it in the sense of making it clear to the other party that he refuses or will refuse to carry out his part of the contract, the other party, the innocent party, has an option. He may accept that repudiation and sue for damages for breach of contract whether or not the time for performance has come; or he may if he chooses disregard or refuse to accept it and then the contract remains in full effect.'<br>• Lord Morton of Henryton: 'It is well established that repudiation by one party does not put an end to a contract. The other party can say 'I hold you to your contract,' which still remains in force. What then is his remedy if the repudiating party persists in his repudiation and refuses to carry out his part of the contract? The contract has been broken. The innocent party is entitled to be compensated by damages for any loss which he has suffered by reason of the breach, and in a limited class of cases the Court will decree specific implement. The law of Scotland provides no other remedy for a breach of contract, and there is no reported case which decides that the innocent party may act as the Appellants have acted.'"

Hilland brought judicial review proceedings challenging this practice as discriminatory.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The issue was whether the ORU's recall practice for DCS prisoners was discriminatory and in breach of Article 14 (concerning discrimination) of the European Convention on Human Rights, compared with the practice for prisoners serving indeterminate custodial sentences (ICS) and extended custodial sentences (ECS). <br>• Hilland argued that DCS, ECS, and ICS prisoners are in analogous situations, hence any difference in treatment must be objectively justified. <br>• The Department of Justice asserted, successfully at first instance and the Court of Appeal, that the different categories of prisoners are not in analogous situation, and even if they were, the difference in treatment was into objectively justified.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal, holding that the treatment was not discriminatory in breach of Article 14. <br>• The court found the different categories of prisoners are not in analogous situations because each sentencing regime, including licencing and recall provisions, is designed for particular circumstances. <br>• The court also observed that the recall practice was objectively justified in the wider context of the differing offending and risk categories represented by each type of prisoner."

An assumption of such antiquity should not lightly be brushed aside, but the contrary has scarcely been argued and never considered in depth. ... I conclude below in considering contribution that, if the relevant relationships yield dual control, it is highly likely at least that the measure of control will be equal. An equal measure of control will not often arise. Dual vicarious liability is most unlikely to be a possibility if one of the candidates for such liability is also personally at fault. It would be entirely redundant, if both were.' - Lord Justice May<br>• 'I would hazard, however, the view that what one is looking for is a situation where the employee in question, at any rate for relevant purposes, is so much a part of the work, business or organisation of both employers that it is just to make both employers answer for his negligence. What has to be recalled is that the vicarious liability in question is one which involves no fault on the part of the employer. It is a doctrine designed for the sake of the claimant imposing a liability incurred without fault because the employer is treated by the law as picking up the burden of an organisational or business relationship which he has undertaken for his own benefit.' - Lord Justice Rix"

The court was unanimous in rejecting the Court of Appeal’s view that the question required an evaluative judgment, deciding that it was a question of causation.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court by majority found the council's decision unlawful. The emissions occurring from burning the extracted oil were traced as 'effects of the project' under the EIA Directive.<br>• The Council's restriction of the EIA to onsite emissions was criticized, arguing there's no geographical limit to environmental effects.<br>• The refining process of crude oil was not found to be breaking the causal connection between the extraction and combustion.

They were in a much better position than Mr Mardon to make a forecast.

In this connection I note that the clause instantly in question appeared in bills of lading before the Midland Silicones case and was not drawn in the light of that case. Alternatively, no doubt, exemption could in practice be secured by a suitably drawn indemnity clause. Finally, there seems no reason to question that, as Turner P. thought, a bill of lading could, if appropriately drafted, contain an offer giving rise to a unilateral contract with a stevedore.' - Lord Wilberforce"

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• This case arises from a dispute concerning a charter-party agreement made in Tokyo on the 26th December 1956, using the 'Uniform Time Charter' of the Baltic and International Maritime Conference.<br>• The vessel 'Hong Kong Fir' was owned by Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd (plaintiffs) and was chartered to Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (defendants).<br>• After several delays and failures in the vessel's engine room staff performance, causing the vessel to be unseaworthy, the defendants cancelled the charter-party on 6th June 1957.<br>• Plaintiffs argued the cancellation was unjustifiable and considered it a wrongful repudiation, holding defendants liable for damages, subsequently leading to litigation in the Commercial Court.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Defendants argued the vessel was unseaworthy upon delivery, justifying the cancellation of the charter-party.<br>• Plaintiffs contended that the defendants' cancellation was wrongful as they had breached the charter-party with unreasonable delay, not amounting to frustration of the contractual purpose.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court dismissed the appeal, upholding that the unseaworthiness due to inefficient and insufficient engine-room staff did not justify contract termination but entitled the plaintiffs to damages.<br>• It was ruled that mere delays and remediable breaches do not necessarily frustrate the commercial purpose of the contract.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'If what is done or not done in breach of the contractual obligation does not make the performance a totally different performance of the contract from that intended by the parties, it is not so fundamental as to undermine the whole contract. Many existing conditions of unseaworthiness can be remedied by attention or repairs, many are intended to be rectified as the voyage proceeds, so that the vessel becomes seaworthy; and, as the judgment points out, the breach of a shipowner's obligation to deliver a seaworthy vessel has not been held by itself to entitle a charterer to escape from the charter-party.' - Lord Justice Sellers<br>• 'It is open to the parties to a charter-party to make it clear either expressly or by necessary implication that a particular stipulation is to be regarded as a condition which goes to the root of the contract, so that it is clear that the parties contemplate that any breach of it entitles the other party at once to treat the contract as at an end.' - Lord Justice Upjohn"

There may be a different rule in the case of a friendly society in which the purpose of membership is to build the assets of the society for distribution according to the members' contributions.

Everything turns on the context.' - Coulson LJ<br>• 'In my view, it would be unrealistic to ignore the fact that this claim is brought by Goodlife's insurers. To that extent, the existence of this subrogated claim confirms what Rix LJ said in Regus: the insurers of the owner, who know in detail what the property consists of and what the losses might be if there was an interruption to the business, are in a much better position to provide proper insurance than the insurer of a third party supplier who has no knowledge of any of those matters of detail. Neither can there be any suggestion that Goodlife did not have the time to consider and explore the alternative option. After all, there was more than a year between their receipt of the term proposed by Hall Fire, and their agreement to the contract. There was ample time for the insurance position to be fully explored. The fact that it was not raised at all with Hall Fire may therefore suggest that Goodlife was happy with its insurance cover. Accordingly I have concluded that the position in relation to insurance is not neutral, but is instead a critical factor in Hall Fire's favour.'"

This is quite insufficient to support the case for repudiation.' - Lord Wilberforce<br>• 'In my opinion therefore the appellants are entitled to succeed on the repudiation issue, and I would only add that it would be a regrettable development of the law of contract to hold that a party who bona fide relies upon an express stipulation in a contract in order to rescind or terminate a contract should, by that fact alone, be treated as having repudiated his contractual obligations if he turns out to be mistaken as to his rights.' - Lord Wilberforce"

Toppan then leased the property to Abbey.<br>• In 2018, fire safety defects were found and allegedly not rectified by Simply. Consequently, Abbey paid for remedial works.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Abbey made claims against Simply for fire safety defects and the cost of rectification.<br>• The Technology and Construction Court awarded Toppan but dismissed Abbey's application, stating that the warranty given to Abbey wasn’t a construction contract under section 104(1) of the 1996 Act, hence denying the Adjudicator's jurisdiction.<br>• The Court of Appeal held that a collateral warranty could be a construction contract and the Abbey Collateral Warranty was such.<br>• The Supreme Court was then approached to determine whether the Abbey Collateral Warranty is a construction contract within the 1996 Act.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal.<br>• The Court held that the purpose of a collateral warranty is usually to provide a right of action for defectively completed construction works and not the performance of such operations.<br>• In this context, the Court ruled that a collateral warranty is not an agreement for the execution of construction operations if it merely promises to fulfil obligations owed to someone else under the building contract.<br>• The Court further stated that the majority interpretation in the Court of Appeal led to fine distinctions in the drafting and interpretation of collateral warranties, whereas a more principled and feasible approach would be to differentiate between warranties that merely replicate building contract's undertakings and those that give rise to separate or distinct obligations.<br>• With this approach, the Court concluded that the Abbey Collateral Warranty was not a construction contract."

The court found that the annuity was not given to the trustees beneficially but a trust for the maintenance of the living animals was created and was enforceable.<br> • The court left the issue of who should benefit from the surplus of the £750 annuity - the testator’s heir-at-law or the devisee of the freehold estates - unresolved.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br> • 'The first question is as to the validity of the provision made by the testator in favour of his horses and dogs.

For reasons given, however, I agree with the judge that such breach was not causative of substantial loss. Formally, I consider that the correct course would be to allow NIAL's appeal, set aside paragraph 1 of the judge's order by which she dismissed NIAL's claim and substitute for it an order that Eversheds must pay NIAL nominal damages of £2 for breach of retainer.' - Lord Justice Rimer"

But not having done so then and Lexi continuing in business, it was the duty of Zaurian to inform the incoming directors of what she knew or ought to have known, namely the convictions and the fact that the Directors' Loan Account was fictitious. If Monuza had not known before that the Directors' Loan Account was fictitious she ought to have known shortly after her appointment both from Zaurian and from performing her own duties as a director of Lexi.' - The Chancellor"

The view which I have taken of the meaning and effect of article 105(2) leads, necessarily, to the conclusion that that question must be answered in the negative. The French court was seized on the basis of the national trade mark 'PRUMERICA'. The United Kingdom court is seized, under article 92 of the Regulation, on the basis of the CTMs 'PRU' and 'PRUDENTIAL'. Whether or not the marks are valid for identical goods or services, the requirement of dual identity is not satisfied. The marks on the basis of which the two courts are seized are not themselves identical. Article 105(2) can have no application in the present case.' - Lord Justice Chadwick"

The 11-storey tower built in the 1950's by Stockport MBC's predecessor was not in itself an unusual use of land. Nor was it an unusual use of land to provide a three inch asbestos cement pipe carrying water, under normal mains pressure, into the water tank room in the basement of the flats.

Notices were posted, but often ignored.<br>• Tomlinson was aware of the prohibition against swimming.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Tomlinson argued for financial compensation, basing liability on occupiers' liability statutes.<br>• Initially, Tomlinson was considered a 'visitor', but diving transformed his status to 'trespasser', modifying the duty owed to him.<br>• The Council argued that adequate warning was provided through signage disclaiming liability for swimming-related injuries.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The House of Lords reversed the Court of Appeal's decision favouring Tomlinson, ruling no liability on the part of Council under both the Occupiers' Liability Acts of 1957 and 1984.<br>• The accident resulted from an activity Tomlinson was expressly prohibited from and had clear knowledge of its potential danger.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• LORD HOFFMANN: 'I think it will be extremely rare for an occupier of land to be under a duty to prevent people from taking risks which are inherent in the activities they freely choose to undertake upon the land.

But he was not doing any such thing. He was simply sporting about in the water with his friends, giving free rein to his exuberance. And why not? And why should the Council be discouraged by the law of tort from providing facilities for young men and young women to enjoy themselves in this way? Of course there is some risk of accidents arising out of the joie de vivre of the young. But that is no reason for imposing a grey and dull safety regime on everyone. This appeal must be allowed.'"

The issue was identifying which subcontractor was vicariously liable for Darren Strang’s negligence.<br>• Thermal Transfer argued Strang's immediate employment control remained with CAT Metalwork.<br>• CAT Metalwork argued the opposite, pointing to a control transfer.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The court explored dual vicarious liability possibility, traditionally unaccepted under English Law, due to shared control over Strang’s actions.<br>• The court found both Thermal Transfer and CAT Metalwork vicariously liable due to shared control and responsibilities.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'The court is not, therefore, concerned to look for personal responsibility in the employer based on what might otherwise have been direct responsibility – for example, whether Mr Hall trained Darren Strang adequately or not. Vicarious liability derives from the relationship between the employee and the employers, the critical relationship being the employers' right (and theoretical obligation) to control the relevant activity of the employee. If the relationships yield dual control, it is highly likely at least that the measure of control will be equal, for otherwise the court would be unlikely to find dual control.' - Lord Justice May<br>• 'I would prefer to say that I anticipate that subsequent cases may, in various factual circumstances, refine the circumstances in which dual vicarious liability may be imposed. I would hazard, however, the view that what one is looking for is a situation where the employee in question, at any rate for relevant purposes, is so much a part of the work, business or organisation of both employers that it is just to make both employers answer for his negligence.' - Lord Justice Rix"

The burden of showing that responsibility has moved to a temporary employer rests on the general employer and is a heavy one. The inquiry should focus on the negligent act and the court should ask itself whose duty it was to prevent that act. A number of other factors may be relevant to which we shall return when we deal with the facts of this case.' - Lady Justice Hallett<br>• 'Whatever approach one adopts we are not persuaded that on the facts of this case it makes any difference. In our judgment, it would not be appropriate to attribute vicarious liability to both ASE and Luminar. In this case, there has been effectively and substantially a transfer of control and responsibility from ASE to Luminar. The facts of this case are very different from those in Viasystems where a finding of dual liability, if permissible in law, was inevitable on the facts.' - Lady Justice Hallett."

Biffa Waste subcontracted MEH, which then subcontracted HU, and further subcontracted OT for installation. OT subcontracted the welding work to Pickfords.<br>• During welding, a fire broke out due to inadequate safety measures, resulting in significant damage and delay.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• OT contended it should not be held liable for the negligence of Pickfords, arguing that it was an independent contractor.<br>• Ramsey J found OT liable on the bases of vicarious liability for a 'borrowed' employee and the rule that a defendant is liable for ultra hazardous activities performed by an independent contractor.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court of Appeal reversed the trial judge’s decision, holding that OT was not vicariously liable for the actions of Pickfords' employees.<br>• The court clarified that the work, although carried out without recommended precautions making it dangerous, was not 'ultra hazardous' by its nature and hence the liability for independent contractors should not be imposed.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• '... in our judgment the doctrine enunciated in Honeywill is so unsatisfactory that its application should be kept as narrow as possible. It should be applied only to activities that are exceptionally dangerous whatever precautions are taken.' - Lord Justice Stanley Burnton<br>• '... in the present case, on the basis of Honeywill the activity to be assessed is welding per se, in the Ball Mill, not welding in the vicinity of unwetted combustible material. Mr Patten rightly concedes that welding as such is not ultra-hazardous. The error of the judge, understandable given the unsatisfactory principle involved, was to take into account in assessing the dangerousness of the welding the factors which were not OT's responsibility rendering it hazardous while leaving out of account the factors that would and should have rendered it safe. It follows that OT should not have been held vicariously liable for the damage caused by its having been carried out without the proper precautions identified by the judge.' - Lord Justice Stanley Burnton"

It inevitably follows that the scheme for bereavement damages is properly regarded as a positive measure, or modality, by which the State has shown respect for family life, a core value of Article 8.' - Sir Terence Etherton MR<br>• '... in the context of bereavement damages under section 1A of the FAA, the situation of someone like Ms Smith, who was in a stable and long term relationship in every respect equal to a marriage in terms of love, loyalty and commitment, is sufficiently analogous to that of a surviving spouse or civil partner to require discrimination to be justified in order to avoid infringement of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8. In the context of this particular scheme, it is not the special legal status and legal consequences of marriage and civil partnership that are material, in the sense of providing a rational distinction with other people and relationships: cf, for example, Burden, in which the ECrtHR rejected the complaint of two unmarried sisters, who had lived together all their lives, that the liability to inheritance tax payable on the death of one of them, which would not be faced by the survivor of a marriage or civil partnership, would violate their rights under Article 14 read with A1P1. Rather, it is the intimacy of a stable and long term personal relationship, whose fracture due to death caused by another's tortious conduct will give rise to grief which ought to be recognised by an award of bereavement damages, and which is equally and analogously present in relationships involving married couples and civil partners and unmarried and unpartnered cohabitees.' - Sir Terence Etherton MR"

The last of these breaches and ITC's threat not to honour the rights granted to Yam Seng in respect of Hong Kong and Macau were repudiatory in nature and justified Yam Seng in terminating the Agreement.' - Mr Justice Leggatt"

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The vessel 'Sea Angel' was chartered by Tsavliris from Global, which in turn chartered from Edwinton Commercial Corporation. <br>• The charter was for a short period of 20 days to assist in salvage operations involving the tanker 'Tasman Spirit'. <br>• Towards the end of the charter, the vessel was unlawfully detained by Karachi Port Trust (KPT) causing a delay of about three months. <br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Tsavliris argued that the charter was frustrated due to the extensive delay caused by the unlawful detention. <br>• They contended that the delay was radical as it significantly exceeded the agreed charter period. <br>• Edwinton and Global argued that Tsavliris bore the risk of such delays under the charterparty terms, which included provisions for salvage operations' risks.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The court, led by Lord Justice Rix, upheld the decision of Mr Justice Gross at trial, ruling that the charter had not been frustrated. <br>• It was determined that the detention, although lengthy, was a risk foreseeable in the salvage context and should have been within the contemplation of experienced salvors like Tsavliris. <br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'it is now common ground, on the particular facts of this case, that, short as the charter was, a mere 20 days, and shorter still as the unexpired period of the charter was, a mere 3 days, there was no frustration until the strategy of commercial negotiation had initially failed (by 13 or 17 October), some five weeks after the detention began. So, in any event, this is not a case like Anglo-Northern and Tatem v. Gamboa, where the charters were frustrated then and there by the supervening event.' - Lord Justice Rix<br>• 'In a sense, most events are to a greater or lesser degree foreseeable. That does not mean that they cannot lead to frustration. Even events which are not merely foreseen but made the subject of express contractual provision may lead to frustration: as occurs when an event such as a strike, or a restraint of princes, lasts for so long as to go beyond the risk assumed under the contract and to render performance radically different from that contracted for. However, as Treitel shows through his analysis of the cases, and as Chitty summarises, the less that an event, in its type and its impact, is foreseeable, the more likely it is to be a factor which, depending on other factors in the case, may lead on to frustration.' - Lord Justice Rix"

On the other hand, it is a rational and defensible strategy to impose wider liability on an intentional wrongdoer ... as between the fraudster and the innocent party, moral considerations militate in favour of requiring the fraudster to bear the risk of misfortunes directly caused by his fraud.

Unless that exception applies, Mr. Tribe's claim to recover his own shares from the Son whom he trusted to hold them as his nominee must fail.'<br>• LORD JUSTICE MILLETT: 'One might hesitate before allowing a novel exception to a rule of legal policy, particularly a rule based on moral principles. But the primary rule, as it has emerged from that decision, does not conform to any discernible moral principle. It is procedural in nature and depends on the adventitious location of the burden of proof in any given case. Had Mr. Tribe transferred the shares to a stranger or distant relative whom he trusted, albeit for the same dishonest purpose, it cannot be doubted that he would have succeeded in his claim. He would also have succeeded if he had given them to his Son and procured him to sign a declaration of trust in his favour. But he chose to transfer them to a Son whom he trusted to the extent of dispensing with the precaution of obtaining a declaration of trust. If that is fatal to his claim, then the greater the betrayal, the less the power of equity to give a remedy.'"

The passage just cited from the judgment of Lord Eldon LC makes it clear that equity imposes stringent liability on a fiduciary as a deterrent – pour encourager les autres. Trust law recognises what in company law is now sometimes called the 'agency' problem. There is a separation of beneficial ownership and control and the shareholders (who may be numerous and only have small numbers of shares) or beneficial owners cannot easily monitor the actions of those who manage their business or property on a day to day basis. Therefore, in the interests of efficiency and to provide an incentive to fiduciaries to resist the temptation to misconduct themselves, the law imposes exacting standards on fiduciaries and an extensive liability to account.' - Lady Justice Arden"

But in a case in which the only contest is between the claimant seeking to trace (Mr Mimran) and the wrongdoer (WIB/Mr Russo), there is, he says, every reason why the latter's interests should be subordinated to the claimant's. Normally, it is presumed that if a trustee uses money from a fund in which he has mixed trust money with his own, he uses his own money first (In re Hallett's Estate (1880) 13 Ch D 696). But Mr Smith submits that this is not an inflexible rule and that if the trustee can be shown to have made an early application of the mixed fund into an investment, the beneficiary is entitled to claim that for himself. He says, and I agree, that this is supported by In re Oatway, Hertslet v Oatway [1903] 2 Ch 356. The justice of this is that, if the beneficiary is not entitled to do this, the wrongdoing trustee may be left with all the cherries and the victim with nothing.

Acceptance that Mr Webb intended to create trusts does not in any way preclude a finding that he reserved such broad powers to himself as settlor and beneficiary that he failed to make an effective disposition of the relevant property. Moreover, and as I have explained, the powers of clause 10 are conferred on Mr Webb as settlor, not in his capacity as Trustee or Consultant. These powers were therefore amply sufficient for Mr Webb to arrange matters in such a way that he alone would hold the trust property on trust for himself and no-one else, with the consequence that the legal and beneficial interest in all of that property would vest in him.' - Lord Kitchin"

The 1000Z. policy was specifically under Mrs. Williams' name, and the 300Z. policy was under Dr. Williams.<br>• Upon the death of Mrs. Williams, she complied with the wishes concerning the 300Z. policy but not the 1000Z. policy, leading to legal proceedings to determine the legal weight of the testator's 'wishes'.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Executors of Mrs. Lucy Williams argued that the will's language imposed no legal obligation, but merely expressed a hope or belief.<br>• Opposing counsel (representing Lucy Norris and her incumbrancers) contended that the words 'in the fullest confidence' used in the will were intended to be imperative, creating a binding obligation on Mrs. Williams that should be upheld.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• It was held by the Chancery Division that the words expressed in the will did not create a legally-binding trust or condition. Mrs. Williams was found to have absolute dominion over the estate, including the 1000Z. policy, and thus she was not bound to leave it to her daughter.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• Lindley L.J.: 'There can be no doubt that equitable obligations, whether trusts or conditions, can be imposed by any language which is clear enough to show an intention to impose an obligation, and is definite enough to enable the Court to ascertain what the precise obligation is and in whose favour it is to be performed.'<br>• Lindley L.J.: 'The testator has employed the same language with respect to his own policy as with respect to his wife’s. He has shewn no intention of imposing an obligation on her in respect of one of them and not in respect of the other. I feel great difficulty in holding that he has not left his own policy to her absolutely free from all trust and condition, and the difficulty of making any distinction between the two policies forces me to the conclusion that the widow is not put to her election as regards her own policy.'"

I am in no doubt that the proper course is for the Siebe Gorman decision to be overruled. It is a tribute to the great respect which Slade LJ's outstandingly careful judgments, both at first instance and the Court of Appeal, have always commanded that his decision in that case has remained unchallenged for so many years. But the fact is that it was a decision that was taken at first instance, and it has now been conclusively demonstrated that the construction which he placed on the debenture was wrong. This is not one of those cases where there are respectable arguments either way. With regret, the conclusion has to be that it is not possible to defend the decision on any rational basis.'<br>• Lord Scott: 'In my opinion, the essential characteristic of a floating charge, the characteristic that distinguishes it from a fixed charge, is that the asset subject to the charge is not finally appropriated as a security for the payment of the debt until the occurrence of some future event. In the meantime the chargor is left free to use the charged asset and to remove it from the security. On this point I am in respectful agreement with Lord Millett. Moreover, recognition that this is the essential characteristic of a floating charge reflects the mischief that the statutory intervention to which I have referred was intended to meet and should ensure that preferential creditors continue to enjoy the priority that section 175 of the 1986 Act and its statutory predecessors intended them to have.'"

It provides a useful benchmark against which our common law can be tested, and against which it can be asked whether the rights of the parties are appropriately balanced. In that sense, the decision in McCann thus seems to me to afford further support for the conclusion that where, when faced with a real and imminent danger, a police officer who relies on self-defence, must show that his belief as to the danger in which he was placed must be both honest and reasonable in the circumstances. It also affords further support for the conclusion already reached by the Master of the Rolls that the submission of the appellants that the defence of self-defence must be applied without reference to the officer's mistaken belief as to whether a real danger existed does not appropriately balance the rights of the appellants and the police in this kind of case.'"

The first qualification is that, as the UT recognised, the authorities do not require that an employer's directions 'be enforceable in the sense that there is an effective sanction for their breach'. I do not consider that there is any such requirement, or that, for the purposes of the control criterion, an employer's directions are only enforceable contractual obligations if there is an effective sanction for their breach. ... The second qualification is that it is not an error of law to give insufficient weight to a relevant matter. Questions of weight are for the first-instance decision-maker, not for the appellate body.'<br>• Justice Laing: 'The FTT and the UT each erred in law in their approaches to the question of mutuality of obligation in the individual contracts, and the FTT erred in law in its approach to the question of control in the individual contracts.'"

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong> <br>• The case involved an adult woman, F, with severe mental disabilities who was incapable of consenting to medical treatment. <br>• F lived in a mental hospital and formed a sexual relationship with a male patient, which possibly involved intercourse. <br>• Concerns arose about the possibility of F becoming pregnant, for which she was incapable of understanding or coping with the implications. <br>• Sterilization by ligation of her Fallopian tubes was proposed as she could not effectively use other forms of contraception due to her mental incapacity and associated health risks. <br><br><strong>Issues</strong> <br>• West Berkshire Health Authority proposed sterilization, arguing that it was in F's best interests, although it lacked her consent. <br>• The Official Solicitor appealed on F's behalf, questioning the lawfulness of the operation without court consent, and whether it was necessary and lawful under common law or if court oversight was required. <br><br><strong>Decision</strong> <br>• The House of Lords found that while sterilization would normally require consent, the operation in F's case could be declared lawful under the principle of necessity—that it was in her best interest given her circumstances. <br>• The court emphasized that such cases should have specific oversight and a declaration of lawfulness should be obtained before proceeding with such treatment to ensure it aligns with the patient’s best interests. <br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong> <br>• Lord Bridge: 'It follows that if the professionals in question have acted with due skill and care, judged by the well-known test laid down in Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 W.L.R. 582, they should be immune from liability in trespass, just as they are immune from liability in negligence.' <br>• Lord Brandon: 'With respect to the Court of Appeal, I do not agree that the Bolam test is inapplicable to cases of performing operations on, or giving other treatment to, adults incompetent to give consent.'"

But in the alternative I would uphold the Court of Appeal's reasoning and conclusions and dismiss this appeal on judicial review grounds (paras 162 to 185): the first, that the decision to enact section 9 of the BIOT Order 2004 was made without regard to relevant considerations and interests, and that, when regard is had thereto, no decision could rationally have been taken on the material available in the sense in which it was, and the second, that the Foreign Secretary's press statement and conduct in introducing the Ordinance on 3 November 2000 gave rise to a legitimate expectation from which no sufficient ground of departure, let alone departure without any prior consultation, has been shown.'"

FP, the mortgagee, held a charge over the relevant lease.<br>• The second defendant, ACP (controlled by FP), was in breach of an agreement to develop a property, which prompted Britel to exercise a 'Lease-Back Option'.<br>• Mr Tamimi, under complex agreements, purchased the lease from FP amidst allegations of conspiracy to commit economic torts and improper exercise of mortgagee's power of sale.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Did FP exercise the power of sale with the proper purpose to secure debt repayment?<br>• Were there breaches of contract and equitable duties by the defendants causing losses to Britel and Meretz?<br>• Was the 'Lease-Back Option' a penalty or legitimate security for performance?<br>• Did the defendants conspire using unlawful means to cause economic loss to Britel and Meretz?<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The court found that FP exercised its power of sale legally, primarily for lawful debt recovery despite having multiple financial purposes.<br>• Britel and Meretz's tort claims were dismissed. Economic losses claimed by Britel and Meretz did not substantiate conspiracy.<br>• The 'Lease-Back Option' was not a penalty but a legitimate part of the contractual arrangement.<br>• ACP was found liable for breach of contract due to the failure to meet the agreed development timetable; Meretz was entitled to damages to be assessed.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'Mr Tamimi had actual or imputed knowledge of the various contractual documents. However, the allegation of improper exercise of the power of sale depends on the allegation that it was no part of FP's purpose in exercising the power to recover its debt. Mr Tamimi had no knowledge of the internal discussions by the boards of ACP and FP and only limited access to the privileged communications between Mr Olsson and Mr Hawkins. Mr Hawkins had told Mr Ware in terms on 29 April 2002 that FP was taking action 'in order to protect its own position as first chargeholder'. I do not consider that Mr Tamimi had knowledge of FP's motivation, apart from what he was told. Nor did he have any suspicion of impropriety about which he decided not to inquire. If, as I think, the scheme devised by Mr Hawkins was capable of being properly used by a mortgagee, Mr Tamimi was entitled to assume that it would be. ... Accordingly, even if FP's exercise of the power of sale had been improper, Mr Tamimi would not have been affected by the impropriety; and his title is unimpeachable.' - Mr Justice Lewison"

There is a respectable case for saying that copyright is not, in general, concerned with functional effects, and there is some advantage in a bright line rule protecting only the claimant's embodiment of the function in software and not some superset of that software. The case is not truly analogous with the plot of a novel, because the plot is part of the work itself. The user interface is not part of the work itself. One could permute all the letters and other codes in the command names, and it would still work in the same way, and all that would be lost is a modest mnemonic advantage. To approach the problem in this way may at least be consistent with the distinction between idea and expression that finds its way into the Software Directive, but, of course, it draws the line between idea and expression in a particular place which some would say lies too far on the side of expression. I think, however, that such is the independence of the particular form of the actual codes used from the overall functioning of the software that it is legitimate to separate them in this way, and not to afford them separate protection when the underlying software is not even arguably copied.' - Mr Justice Pumfrey"

D1 argued that the transfer was a plan ('Claimant's Plan') to enable him to raise finance on behalf of C. <br>• C continued to live in one property, receiving rent from another, raising issues about his continued beneficial interest.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Whether C retains any beneficial interest in the properties post-transfer.<br>• Whether the transfer created a Quistclose trust, given there were specific financial arrangements agreed upon.<br>• Whether D1 breached any fiduciary duty if such a trust existed by not executing the agreed upon financial arrangements.<br>• The legal status of subsequent leases and charges registered by D1 to third parties, D2 and D3.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• It was determined that C did not fully relinquish equitable interest given the circumstances and intentions involved in the transfer.<br>• The transactions made by D1 to raise finances on the properties should be seen as operating under a Quistclose trust, which D1 breached.<br>• Subsequent registrations by D1 conferred valid interests to D2 and D3, which could not be upset by C's overriding interest because they were for valuable consideration and there was no fraud involved.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br> • '... it is absolutely crucial that the payee/recipient of the property (here D1) understands that his use of the property is specifically restricted: he is not entitled to use the property as his own despite his legal ownership of it. Of course it does not matter whether D1 understands the legal niceties – it is rare that he will – but it is necessary that he understands that his newly acquired legal ownership does not come with all the normal incidents of full ownership. That is the case here, on D1's own evidence.' (Sarah Worthington QC)"

			"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• Tesco Stores Ltd ('Tesco') wanted to terminate the employment contracts of certain employees to end their 'retained pay' (RP).<br>• RP was established through a collective agreement in 2007, incentivising employees to relocate following the closure of certain distribution centres. <br>• It was incorporated into the contracts as a 'permanent feature'.<br>• Tesco informed employees that refusal to consent to the removal of RP would result in dismissal and re-engagement on identical terms, without the RP feature.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The employees and USDAW applied to the High Court for clarification of the RP term and to prevent Tesco from terminating their employment to remove the RP entitlement.<br>• Tesco argued the RP term only guaranteed ‘permanence’ during the duration of the contract.<br>• The claimants argued the employer’s right to terminate the contract should not deprive them of their RP entitlement.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court agreed with the claimants, reinstating the lower court’s injunction against Tesco.<br>• It found that implied within the employment contract was the principle that Tesco’s right to terminate couldn't be used to deprive employees of their RP.<br>• Specifying this right didn't interfere with Tesco's liberty to dismiss employees for reasons other than removing the RP entitlement. <br>• The court pointed out the remedial damages for breach of employment contract had enactment limitations, and because such an assessment would involve speculation, expert evidence and additional costs, it justified the original injunction."

Neither the Inspector nor the Secretary of State tackled this substantial point under Issue (iii), because of their reliance upon the net zero mine approach.’ – Mr Justice Holgate."

Here the moneys of Mr Yap and the various investors were mixed and there were no escrow conditions as to their dispersal. In any event, if solicitors are involved escrow conditions are typically related to legal work. While many of the functions associated with conveyancing and acting as an executor are of an administrative nature, their long association with the legal profession gives them the character of professional services. They are part of the everyday practice of solicitors. What the appellant did here, as described in the client care letter, was purely administrative. He was the custodian of funds. That had no association with the professional duties of a solicitor and was not in relation to an underlying legal transaction.' - Mr Justice Cranston"
