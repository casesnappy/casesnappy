			"name": "Sovereign immunity",
			"field": "constitutional",
			"explanation": "<strong>What is sovereign immunity?</strong><br>• Sovereign immunity, often referred to as Crown immunity in the UK, is a legal doctrine that prevents the state or its authorities from being subject to judicial action, such as lawsuits or criminal prosecution without their consent.<br>• In the UK, the concept of Crown immunity is based on an old maxim that 'the King (or Queen) can do no wrong'.<br>• This doctrine applies to central and local government bodies and their officers, as well as the Crown in its public and private capacities.<br><br><strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>• Sovereign immunity is important because it maintains the balance of power between the state and its citizens and prevents the government from being hindered by legal disputes.<br>• It also enables the government to execute its functions effectively and efficiently without the fear of constant legal challenges.<br>• However, the concept has been criticised for allowing potential abuse of power, leading to necessary exceptions and limitations on sovereign immunity.<br><br><strong>Example cases</strong><br>• Entick v Carrington [1765] EWHC KB J98: This seminal case established the idea that state actors, such as government agents, could be held liable for their individual acts even if they claimed to be acting on the Crown's behalf, helping shape the modern concept of sovereign immunity."

			"name": "Actus reus",
			"field": "criminal",
			"explanation": "<strong>What is actus reus?</strong><br>• Actus reus (Latin for 'guilty act') refers to the physical element of a criminal offence. In English law, it constitutes the wrongful act or omission that comprises the external elements of the crime.<br>• The actus reus must be a voluntary act, and it must be a causing or contributing factor to the criminal harm defined by the offence.<br><br><strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>• The concept is important because it serves as the foundation for determining criminal liability. It helps to distinguish between wrongful conduct and mere thoughts or intentions which alone are insufficient for prosecution.<br>• Establishing the actus reus ensures that the defendant is legally responsible for the criminal act, rather than just the harmful consequences.<br>• Without actus reus, a defendant cannot be found guilty of a criminal offence. It must be proven, along with the mental element (mens rea), to satisfy the requirements of a crime.<br><br><strong>Example cases</strong><br>• R v White [1910] 2 KB 124 demonstrated that actus reus and mens rea must coincide. The defendant placed poison in his mother's drink intending to kill her, but she died of a heart attack before consuming the poison. The defendant was acquitted of murder.<br>• R v Miller [1983] 2 AC 161 - involved an act of omission and a continuing act. The defendant’s act of failing to extinguish a fire that he inadvertently started was considered an actus reus. The court held that his omission to act created a duty and breach of that duty constituted actus reus."

		{
			"name": "Mens rea",
			"field": "criminal",
			"explanation": "<strong>What is mens rea?</strong><br>• Mens rea (Latin for 'guilty mind') is an essential element in criminal law, concerning the mental state or intent of an individual committing an offence.<br>• It focuses on the accused's subjective awareness of the criminality of their actions or their decision to engage in unlawful behaviour.<br>• Mens rea often distinguishes between different levels of culpability, such as intent, recklessness, negligence and others, depending on the specific offence.<br><br><strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>• Establishing mens rea is crucial for determining criminal liability, as it ensures that only those who have the requisite guilty mind are held responsible for their actions.<br>• Without it, an individual could be convicted simply on the basis of their actions, regardless of their mental state, which might lead to unjust outcomes.<br>• The existence and level of mens rea can affect the severity of the punishment, with higher levels of culpability typically resulting in harsher sentences.<br>• Assessing mens rea helps to distinguish between criminal conduct and accidents or mistakes that lack the necessary intent or mental state.<br><br><strong>Example cases</strong><br>• R v Moloney [1985] 1 AC 905: A crucial case that defined the test for intention in murder cases, which is central to understanding mens rea.<br>• R v Woolin [1999] 1 AC 82, HL: This case refined the test for intention, emphasizing the importance of foresight of consequences in determining mens rea.<br>• R v G and Another [2003] UKHL 50: The House of Lords held that subjective recklessness is an essential element of the mens rea required for criminal damage, thereby clarifying the importance of the defendant's awareness in establishing liability."

			"name": "Self-defence",
			"field": "criminal",
			"explanation": "<strong>What is Self-defence?</strong><br>• Self-defence is a legal concept used in UK criminal law to justify a person's use of necessary force against an imminent threat of unlawful violence.<br>• It is a complete defence to criminal charges, meaning if successfully argued, it leads to an acquittal.<br>• The force used in self-defence must be proportionate to the threat and deemed reasonable in the circumstances.<br><br><strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>• It is a fundamental concept in criminal law, reflecting the principles of natural rights and individual autonomy.<br>• Self-defence acknowledges that individuals have a right to protect themselves and others from harm, thus allowing the law to strike a balance between the rights of individuals and the need to maintain order.<br>• Ensuring that the law recognises reasonable acts of self-defence helps to avoid punishment of innocent individuals who act out of necessity.<br><br><strong>Example cases</strong><br>• R v Williams (Gladstone) [1984] 78 CrAppR 276: The Court of Appeal held that in cases of self-defence, the test of whether the force used by the defendant was reasonable should be assessed based on their honest belief of the circumstances, even if their belief was mistaken. Additionally, the court emphasized that intoxication could affect the defendant's subjective belief but could not be used to justify objectively unreasonable use of force.<br>• R v Clegg [1995] 1 AC 482: The HL held that an excessive use of force negates self-defence.

			"explanation": "<strong>What is Volenti non fit iniuria?</strong><br>• Volenti non fit iniuria is a Latin phrase, which means 'to one who consents, no harm is done'. This principle refers to a legal defence in tort law, indicating that if someone willingly and knowingly places themselves in a position where harm might result, they cannot bring a claim against the other party.<br>• The defence operates as a complete bar to recovery in cases where the claimant has expressly and voluntarily assumed the risk of their injuries, barring them from claiming negligence.<br><br><strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>• The concept is important because it creates a fair balance between the parties’ rights and responsibilities. It acknowledges that a person who willingly takes on a risk should be responsible for their own actions, rather than placing blame on another party.<br>• It prevents claimants from succeeding in legal actions where they have knowingly and voluntarily engaged in risky activities or accepted the risk of injury.<br>• The principle also respects individual autonomy and decision-making, allowing individuals to exercise their personal choice in assuming risks and reducing unnecessary legal actions.<br><br><strong>Example cases</strong><br>• Nettleship v Weston [1971] 2 QB 691 - Relevance: The defence of Volenti non fit iniuria was not applicable in this case where the claimant, an experienced driver, agreed to teach the inexperienced defendant how to drive. The court held that the claimant did not consent to negligence and the defendant was liable for the accident.<br>• ICI Ltd v Shatwell [1965] AC 656 - Relevance: In this case, employees disregarded explicit safety instructions but were injured during their dangerous actions at work. The court found that the injured employee had consented to the risk of injury, applying the defence of Volenti non fit iniuria."

			"explanation": "<strong>What is strict liability?</strong><br>• Strict liability refers to a legal concept in UK criminal law where a defendant can be found guilty of an offence without the need to prove mens rea (guilty mind) or intention.<br>• These offences generally relate to public welfare, health and safety, and are deemed necessary for the effective enforcement of regulations.<br>• Strict liability offences tend to be less serious, often carrying relatively low penalties.<br><br><strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>• It helps the legal system enforce regulations more effectively by simplifying prosecutions and focusing on actions rather than intentions.<br>• It encourages businesses and individuals to be diligent and proactive in adhering to regulatory requirements, due to the potential risk of liability.<br>• However, the concept is controversial, as it deviates from the fundamental principle that criminal liability should only be imposed where there is a guilty mind.<br><br><strong>Example cases</strong><br>• R v Prince (1875) LR 2 CCR 154: The defendant was convicted of taking an unmarried girl under the age of 16 out of her father's possession, despite his belief that she was older. The conviction established strict liability for statutory offences.<br>• Harrow LBC v Shah (1999) 3 All ER 302: The defendants were found guilty of selling a lottery ticket to an underage person, despite having taken steps to verify the customer's age.

			"name": "Intention",
			"field": "criminal",
			"explanation": "<strong>What is intention?</strong><br>• Intention, in the context of criminal law, refers to the mental element, or mens rea, required for certain crimes. It involves a conscious decision to bring about certain consequences, demonstrating the subjective state of mind necessary for a specific offence.<br>• To prove intention, the prosecution must establish that the defendant foresaw and desired the consequences of their actions.<br><br><strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>• The concept is important as it ensures that only those who possess the required mental state are held criminally responsible for their actions. This helps to distinguish between accidental and intentional criminal acts.<br>• Intention is the most culpable form of mens rea, and thus justifies more severe punishments for those who knowingly and deliberately commit criminal acts.<br>• Establishing intention ensures that the criminal justice system remains fair and does not punish an individual disproportionately for an unintended harm.<br><br><strong>Example cases</strong><br>• R v Mohan [1976] QB 1 - Relevance: This case defined intention as 'a decision to bring about, in so far as it lies within the accused's power, the commission of the offence which it is alleged the accused attempted to commit, no matter whether the accused desired that consequence of his act or not.'.<br>• R v Woolin [1999] 1 AC 82, HL - Relevance: The court held that if a result is virtually certain, and the defendant appreciated that fact, then the jury may find that the defendant intended those consequences."

This principle has since been narrowed and refined but remains an important exception to the general rule that employers are not liable for the actions of independent contractors.<br>• Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance [1968] 2 QB 497 - The Court of Appeal established a test for distinguishing between independent contractors and employees. It considered factors such as control, integration, and whether the worker provided their own equipment and bore the financial risk. As a result, the court ruled that the worker in question was an independent contractor, and the principal was not liable for certain tax and insurance obligations that would have applied had the worker been an employee."

			"name": "Undue influence",
			"field": "contract",
			"explanation": "<strong>What is undue influence?</strong><br>• Undue influence is a legal concept in English contract law.<br>• It refers to a situation where one party to a contract unfairly exploits or pressures another party into entering the agreement, depriving them of their free will.<br>• Undue influence can be exerted through manipulation, coercion, or threats, and it generally involves a relationship of trust or confidence between the parties.<br><br><strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>• Undue influence is important because it protects vulnerable parties from being taken advantage of in contractual situations.<br>• If undue influence is proven, the contract may be considered invalid, and therefore unenforceable.<br>• Identifying and proving undue influence can be challenging, as it often relies on the specific circumstances surrounding the contract and the relationship between the parties.<br>• It is important for legal practitioners to understand the concept to maintain the integrity of contracts and ensure that parties are entering agreements fairly and voluntarily.<br><br><strong>Example cases</strong><br>• Allcard v Skinner (1887) 36 Ch D 145: In this case, undue influence was established in a situation where a nun had given away her wealth to the church, influenced by her religious superior. The Court of Appeal held that the contract could be rescinded on the grounds of undue influence.<br>• Etridge (No.2) [2002] 2 AC 773: The House of Lords established guidelines for dealing with allegations of undue influence in situations where one person provides security for another's debt. It highlighted the importance of independent legal advice in preventing undue influence."

			"name": "Frustration",
			"field": "contract",
			"explanation": "<strong>What is frustration?</strong><br>• Frustration is a concept in UK contract law that refers to the situation where, after a contract is formed, unforeseeable events occur that make it impossible or unlawful to perform the contract, or change the nature of the parties' obligations to the extent that performance would unfairly burdensome.<br>• A frustrated contract is automatically discharged, which means that both parties are released from their obligations under the contract, even if neither party is at fault.<br>• Frustration must be distinguished from other reasons for discharge, such as breach, impossibility, or mutual mistake.<br><br><strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>• The concept of frustration is important because it provides an equitable solution for parties in situations where performance of the contract would be unjust due to circumstances beyond their control.<br>• It acknowledges that external events can significantly change the foundation of the contract and make its original purpose or performance unreasonable or impossible.<br>• Frustration also helps to preserve the principle of pacta sunt servanda ('agreements must be kept'), by relieving parties from their contractual obligations in genuinely 'frustrating' circumstances.<br><br><strong>Example cases</strong><br>• Taylor & Anor v Caldwell & Anor [1863] EWHC QB J1: This landmark case established the doctrine of frustration in English law when a concert hall was accidentally destroyed by fire before a series of performances, making it impossible for the contract to be performed.<br>• Krell v. Henry (1903) 2 KB 740: This case involved the frustration of a contract for a room to view King Edward VII's coronation procession due to the sudden cancellation of the event. The court held that the contract was frustrated as the event formed the basis of the contract."

In this case, a delay in the mail led to confusion about when the contract was formed.<br>• Another noteworthy case is Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant [1879] 4 Ex D 216. The rule was applied to mean that a contract was valid, despite the letter of acceptance being lost in the post.<br>• In more recent times, the importance of the postal rule has been felt in case of Holwell Securities v Hughes [1973] EWCA Civ 5 where it was held that the postal rule would not apply where it would lead to manifest inconvenience and absurdity."
